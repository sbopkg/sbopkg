sbopkg 0.38.1
Usage: sbopkg [OPTIONS] <packagename(s)>
Options are:
  -b pkg/queue(s) Build the specified package(s). If one or more queuefiles
                  are specified, build the packages they refer to.
  -B              Bulk process the queue without confirmation.
  -c              Check for updates to installed packages.
  -D localdir     Location of local copy of the repositories.
  -d pkg/queue(s) Like '-b', but only download sources.
  -e error_action Specify what sbopkg is supposed to do on build errors.
                  Valid options are: ask (default), continue, stop.
  -f file         Override default configuration file with specified file.
  -g package(s)   General search for packages matching string.
  -h              Display this help message.
  -i pkg/queue(s) Like '-b', but also install built packages.
  -k              Skip installed packages when building.
  -l              Display the repo's ChangeLog.txt and then quit.
  -o              Display the obsolete source files & prompt for deletion.
  -P              List uninstalled cached package files & prompt for deletion.
  -p              List installed packages from active repo.
  -q              Quiet some of the command-line output.
  -R              When combined with -b or -i, preview the READMEs of the
                  packages to be built/installed before starting the build
                  process. When combined with -p, show the READMEs of all
                  installed packages from the active repo.
  -r              Sync the remote repository with the local mirror and then
                  quit.
  -s package(s)   Specific search by specific package and, if found,
                  display package information.
  -u              Check for an update to sbopkg.
  -V repo/branch  Set the repository/branch. The repo is optional and, if
                  not given, sbopkg will try to make the best match,
                  starting with the default repo. For a list of valid repos,
                  issue '-V ?'
  -v              Print sbopkg's version on stdout.

Note: multiple arguments to -b, -g, -i, and -s must be quoted ("pkg1 pkg2") or
can be specified multiple times (-i foo -i bar). If using the latter syntax,
build options may also be passed on the command line on a per app basis using
the -b or -i flags in colon-separated groups (where whitespace must also be
quoted). For example, '-i app:opt1="arg1 arg2":opt2=arg1 app2'
