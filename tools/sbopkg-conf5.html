sbopkg.conf - configuration file for sbopkg

<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>sbopkg.conf</I>

file contains configuration settings for
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+sbopkg">sbopkg</A></B>(8),

a tool for interacting with the SlackBuilds.org (``SBo'') repository, a
collection of third-party SlackBuild scripts to build Slackware
packages.
The default configuration file is installed at
<I>/etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf</I>.

The user may override any settings in that file by creating
<I>~/.sbopkg.conf</I>.

<P>

Please see the
<B>NOTES</B>

section for more information about variables, including
<B>ARCH</B>.

<P>

All boolean options require a
<B>YES</B>

or a
<B>NO</B>

without regard to case.
All path values must be full.
<P>

The default configuration options are:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ALLOW_MULTI</B>

<DD>
Boolean.
<DT><DD>
When set to
<B>YES</B>,

this option allows the user to run multiple instances of
<B>sbopkg</B>

simultaneously.
<DT><DD>
Please understand that this option is provided for convenience, but
given the number of potential issues you can face when enabling this
(and we aren't going to try to work around users doing silly things),
you should consider this an EXPERIMENTAL UNSUPPORTED feature.
If you encounter problems, please try to make sure these aren't caused
by yourself doing improper things.
<DT><DD>
For reference, these are some of the things you shouldn't do with this
option enabled:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
run instances with a mixture of
<B>YES</B>

and
<B>NO</B>

settings
<DT>*<DD>
sync a repository when another instance is using it
<DT>*<DD>
change the branch of a git repository when another instance is using it
(this caveat does not apply to rsync repositories)
<DT>*<DD>
simultaneously process the same package from different instances
<DT>*<DD>
save a queue file while using it from another instance
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
There can be more unsafe situations we haven't thought about.
Take care.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
ALLOW_MULTI=${ALLOW_MULTI:-NO}

<DT><B>CLEANUP</B>

<DD>
Boolean.
<DT><DD>
When set to
<B>YES</B>,

the unpacked source files and package tree in
<I>$TMP</I>

are deleted right after the build, though the downloaded source archive
and completed package are left in
<I>$SRCDIR</I>

and
<I>$OUTPUT</I>.

<DT><DD>
A side effect of setting
<B>CLEANUP</B>

to
<B>YES</B>

is that
<B>TMP</B>

is set to
<B>sbopkg</B>'s

own temporary directory
(<I>$TMPDIR/sbopkg.RANDOM_STRING</I>)

and any other
<B>TMP</B>

setting is ignored.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
CLEANUP=${CLEANUP:-NO}

<DT><B>DEBUG_UPDATES</B>

<DD>
Enumeration.
<DT><DD>
This option should be set to
<B>0</B>,

<B>1</B>,

or
<B>2</B>.

<B>DEBUG_UPDATES</B>

sets the default debugging level for the update list feature of
<B>sbopkg</B>.

When set to
<B>0</B>,

only potential updated (or downgraded) packages are listed.
When set to
<B>1</B>,

potential updates plus packages not in the repo and packages that are
newer than the repo are listed.
When set to
<B>2</B>,

all non-updated packages are also listed.
Changing
<B>DEBUG_UPDATES</B>

to
<B>1</B>

or
<B>2</B>

may be helpful if it appears the updatelist might be missing an update.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
DEBUG_UPDATES=${DEBUG_UPDATES:-0}

<DT><B>DIFF</B>

<DD>
Command.
<DT><DD>
This option allows the user to set which diff program to use when
<B>sbopkg</B>

displays differences between edited files.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
DIFF=${DIFF:-diff}

<DT><B>DIFFOPTS</B>

<DD>
Command options.
<DT><DD>
This option allows the user to set which options are used by the
<I>$DIFF</I>

program when
<B>sbopkg</B>

displays differences between edited files.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
DIFFOPTS=${DIFFOPTS:--u}

<DT><B>KEEPLOG</B>

<DD>
Boolean.
<DT><DD>
This option allows the user to choose whether to keep a permanent log of
packages that are built with
<B>sbopkg</B>

in order to review the builds for historical or troubleshooting
purposes.
See
<B>LOGFILE</B>

for the location of this log.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
KEEPLOG=${KEEPLOG:-YES}

<DT><B>LOGFILE</B>

<DD>
Path.
<DT><DD>
This option sets the name for the build log if
<B>KEEPLOG</B>

is set to
<B>YES</B>.

<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
LOGFILE=${LOGFILE:-/var/log/sbopkg/sbopkg-build-log}

<DT><B>MKDIR_PROMPT</B>

<DD>
Boolean.
<DT><DD>
When set to
<B>YES</B>,

<B>sbopkg</B>

will prompt for confirmation before changing the filesystem by creating
its directories.
If you do not wish to be prompted (for instance, if you have some of the
directories on a temporary filesystem and don't wish to be prompted for
confirmation each time the filesystem is reinitialized) you can set this
to
<B>NO</B>.

<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
MKDIR_PROMPT=${MKDIR_PROMPT:-YES}

<DT><B>NICE</B>

<DD>
Integer.
<DT><DD>
This value is passed to
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+nice">nice</A></B>(1)

as its
<B>-n</B>

argument.




If this value is unset or left at the default,
<B>sbopkg</B>

will execute SlackBuilds with
<B>nice</B>'s

default niceness, which is
<B>10.</B>

If you do not wish the priority to be effected, be sure to set it to
<B>0</B>.

Note that this only affects SlackBuild execution and does not affect the
priority of
<B>sbopkg</B>

as a whole.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
NICE=${NICE:-10}

<DT><B>OUTPUT</B>

<DD>
Path.
<DT><DD>
This option sets the default directory where compiled packages are
saved.
<B>OUTPUT</B>

must be exported as it is also used by the SBo SlackBuilds.
Note that the default value of
<B>OUTPUT</B>

is therefore the same as in the SBo SlackBuilds.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
export OUTPUT=${OUTPUT:-/tmp}

<DT><B>QUEUEDIR</B>

<DD>
Path.
<DT><DD>
This option defines the directory under which saved queue files will be
kept.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
QUEUEDIR=${QUEUEDIR:-/var/lib/sbopkg/queues}

<DT><B>REPO_BRANCH</B>

<DD>
Enumeration.
<DT><DD>
This option allows the user to set the default active repository branch.
The current standard values are listed in the default
<I>repos.d/*</I>

files and can also be listed by issuing
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<PRE>
# sbopkg -V ?
</PRE>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
REPO_BRANCH=${REPO_BRANCH:-14.2}

<DT><B>REPO_NAME</B>

<DD>
Enumeration.
<DT><DD>
This option allows the user to choose the repository to use.
See
<B>REPO_BRANCH</B>

for how to get an enumeration of standard values.
The ``local'' choice corresponds to a user-maintained repository whose
structure must be the same as the one used by SBo, in the sense of a
<I>category/package/files</I>

hierarchy.
Note: all of the
<B>REPO_*</B>

variables are affected by the repository files maintained in
<I>/etc/sbopkg/repos.d.</I>

Please see the
<I>README-repos</I>

document in the
<B>sbopkg</B>

documentation directory.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
REPO_NAME=${REPO_NAME:-SBo}

<DT><B>REPO_ROOT</B>

<DD>
Path.
<DT><DD>
This option allows the user to set the location of the local mirrors of
the remote repositories.
Currently, the size of a local copy of the SBo repository is about 221MB.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
REPO_ROOT=${REPO_ROOT:-/var/lib/sbopkg}

<DT><B>RSYNCFLAGS</B>

<DD>
Command options.
<DT><DD>
<B>Rsync</B>

is used by
<B>sbopkg</B>

to mirror the SBo repository.
This option allows the user to manually tweak the
<B>rsync</B>

flags (options) that are used by
<B>sbopkg</B>.

Users are cautioned against making any changes to the default values
since new flags may or may not work.
Note: the
<B>rsync</B>

command in
<B>sbopkg</B>

already uses the
<B>--archive</B>,

<B>--delete</B>,

<B>--no-owner</B>,

and
<B>--exclude</B>

flags, so there is no need to add them to the
<B>RSYNCFLAGS</B>

option.
Changing those internal default options is not recommended.
However,
<B>--timeout</B>

is a useful option to play with if getting syncing errors.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
RSYNCFLAGS=&quot;${RSYNCFLAGS:---verbose --timeout=30}&quot;

<DT><B>SRCDIR</B>

<DD>
Path.
<DT><DD>
This option contains the location of the cache directory where source
downloads will be saved.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
SRCDIR=${SRCDIR:-/var/cache/sbopkg}

<DT><B>TMP</B>

<DD>
Path.
<DT><DD>
This option sets the default directory where built packages are saved.
<B>TMP</B>

must be exported as it is also used by the SBo SlackBuilds.
Note that the default value of
<B>TMP</B>

is therefore the same as in the SBo SlackBuilds.
<DT><DD>
Also note that if the
<B>CLEANUP</B>

variable is set to
<B>YES</B>,

any custom
<B>TMP</B>

setting is ignored.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
export TMP=${TMP:-/tmp/SBo}

<DT><B>TMPDIR</B>

<DD>
Path.
<DT><DD>
This option sets the default directory where certain working files
specific to
<B>sbopkg</B>

are saved on a temporary basis. Note that this variable is actually used
by
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+mktemp">mktemp</A></B>(1),

and that the actual directory is hardcoded internally to
<I>sbopkg.XXXXXX</I>

where 'XXXXXX' is a random string.
This variable determines the containing directory for that.
If /tmp is not a suitable containing directory, TMPDIR can be assigned
to on the command line when invoking
<B>sbopkg</B>

or the variable can be modified in
<I>sbopkg.conf</I>.

<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
export TMPDIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}

<DT><B>WGETFLAGS</B>

<DD>
Command options.
<DT><DD>
<B>Wget</B>

is used by
<B>sbopkg</B>

to download the source files for package building.
This option allows the user to manually tweak the
<B>wget</B>

flags (options) that are used by
<B>sbopkg</B>.

Users are cautioned against making any changes to the default values
since new flags may or may not work.
However,
<B>--timeout</B>

is a useful option to play with if getting download errors.
<DT><DD>
The default assignment is:
<DT><DD>
WGETFLAGS=&quot;${WGETFLAGS:--c --progress=bar:force --timeout=30 --tries=5}&quot;

<DT><B>SRC_REPO</B>

<DD>
Path.
<DT><DD>
This option sets the alternative third party source repository that can
be used to download the source files for package building.
<DT><DD>
The default value is hard-coded to http://slackware.uk/sbosrcarch

<H2>NOTES</H2>


<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Overriding Environmental Variables</H3>

It is possible to set or override environmental variables and pass them
to the SlackBuilds when they are built from within
<B>sbopkg</B>.

This is already demonstrated in the following example line (and others
like it) in the
<I>sbopkg.conf</I>

file:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<PRE>
export TMP=${TMP:-/tmp/SBo}
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This sets
<B>TMP</B>

to
<I>/tmp/SBo</I>

for building SBo packages within
<B>sbopkg</B>

(which is currently the default for SBo SlackBuilds already).
Since this variable is exported, it could be changed for both
<B>sbopkg</B>

and for building SBo packages within
<B>sbopkg</B>.

For example, changing this line so it reads:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<PRE>
export TMP=${TMP:-/home/sbo/tmp}
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

would then set
<B>TMP</B>

to
<I>/home/sbo/tmp</I>

for building SBo packages and still allow it to be overridden at runtime
by invoking
<B>sbopkg</B>

as
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<PRE>
# export TMP=foo; sbopkg
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

<B>OUTPUT</B>

can also be changed to save compiled packages in a location other than
the default of
<I>/tmp</I>.

<P>

You can also export variables in
<I>sbopkg.conf</I>

that are not used by
<B>sbopkg</B>

at all.

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>About the ARCH Variable</H3>

You may be wondering why
<B>ARCH</B>

is not a configuration setting in the default
<I>sbopkg.conf</I>

file.
The reason is that it does not have to be.
If
<B>ARCH</B>

is not set,
<B>sbopkg</B>

does some checking (using the output of
<B>uname -m</B>)

to determine what the system's architecture is.
If the architecture is x86, x86_64, or arm*, then
<B>sbopkg</B>

automatically sets
<B>ARCH</B>

to i486, x86_64, or arm, respectively.
If
<B>ARCH</B>

is set,
<B>sbopkg</B>

will inherit that setting.
This means the user can add, for example,
<B>export ARCH=i686</B>

in their
<I>.bashrc</I>

or similar file, or the user can also execute something in the
root terminal like
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<PRE>
# export ARCH=i686; sbopkg
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The user can also manually add it to their
<I>sbopkg.conf</I>

file if they wish.
Finally, if
<B>ARCH</B>

is not set by the user and
<B>sbopkg</B>

does not detect one of the previously mentioned architectures, then
<B>ARCH</B>

will be set by whatever is in the SlackBuilds.
Note that the SlackBuild may, in certain instances, discard or override
previous
<B>ARCH</B>

settings if this is required for the build.
