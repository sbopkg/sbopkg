SBOPKG(8)                                                                                                                             SBOPKG(8)

NAME
       sbopkg  - The SlackBuilds.org Package Browser

SYNOPSIS
       sbopkg [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Sbopkg  is  a  command-line  and  dialog-based tool to interact with the SlackBuilds.org ("SBo") repository, a collection of third-party
       SlackBuild scripts to build Slackware packages.

INSTRUCTIONS
       Before sbopkg can be  used,  a  configuration  file  must  be  created  at  /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf.   A  sample  file  is  provided  at
       /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf.sample. See sbopkg.conf (5) for more information about the configuration file.

       Sbopkg  can  be  run  from the command line by simply invoking "sbopkg."  Doing so will launch the dialog-based interface, and the menus
       provided should be fairly self-explanatory.  The main menu allows the user to rsync with the SlackBuilds.org repository, view the Slack-
       Builds.org  Changelog,  display  the  contents of the local cache directory where source tarballs are saved, display the permanent build
       log, and browse or search the local copy of the SBo repository.  Once the browse function is chosen, the user can select the category of
       software to view.  After choosing a category, the user can then view the various software packages available in that category within the
       local SBo repository.  Selecting a package will display another menu allowing the user to view the package's README, SlackBuild,  .info,
       or  slack-desc  files.  The user can also edit the SlackBuild and the edited SlackBuild will remain after doing an rsync.  Additionally,
       if sbopkg is run with root privileges, then the user can choose to build a package as well using either the original SlackBuild  or  the
       locally-edited  one, if present.  Finally, if KEEPLOG is set to YES in the sbopkg.conf file then a permanent log of the build process is
       saved in /tmp/sbopkg-build-log.

       Alternatively, sbopkg can be run from the command line without using the dialog interface.  Executing "sbopkg -h" will display a list of
       options available from the command line.

       Certain  features  of  sbopkg rely on outside binaries, such as a pager to view the text files when sbopkg is run from the comamnd line,
       and an editor to edit the SlackBuild.  The pager function will look to the environmental variable $PAGER and if  that  variable  is  not
       defined  then  it  will  default to 'more.'  Similarly, the edit SlackBuild function found when sbopkg is used with the dialog interface
       will look to $EDITOR and will default to 'vi' if no $EDITOR has been defined.  If the user wants sbopkg to use another EDITOR,  such  as
       nano, then adding the requisite information in ~/.bashrc or other similar configuration file to export EDITOR will suffice.

OPTIONS
       -b PACKAGE(s)
            Search for and build PACKAGE(s) from the local SBo repository.  If more than one package is specified, they must be in quotes.  For
            example "sbopkg -b "foo bar".

       -d DIRECTORY
            Manually specify the full path to the DIRECTORY containing the local SBo repository.

       -f   Override the default configuration file, which is located by default at /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf, with another configuration file.

       -h   Display the help.

       -l   Display the SBo ChangeLog.txt and quit.

       -q PACKAGE(s)
            Query for PACKAGE(s) by glob.  For example, 'sbopkg -q nv' will return a list of matches, such as the  nvidia  packages,  konversa-
            tion, and other packages with 'nv' in their name.

       -r   Rsync the local repository with SlackBuilds.org and quit.

       -s PACKAGE(s)
            Search  for  PACKAGE(s) by specific PACKAGE name and, if found, display the README, SlackBuild, .info, and slack-desc files in that
            order using $PAGER, which defaults to 'more' as decribed above.   If more than one package is specified, they must  be  in  quotes.
            For example "sbopkg -s "foo bar".

       -v VERSION
            Set the Slackware version to use for the matching local SBo mirror.  Current options are 11.0 and 12.0.

FILES
       /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf  - File to specify configuration options.
