SBOPKG KNOWN ISSUES

The following are the known user-visible issues in sbopkg or upstream in
the tools it uses:

* In dialog versions before 20100119 the left/right arrows in
  '--inputbox' widgets (the boxes the user types text into) do not
  navigate in a button context. (They do navigate in an editing
  context.)

  Workaround: navigate with up/down arrows or tab/shift-tab.

* If dialog is run in a terminal emulator and the user exits using the
  window manager's 'close' (or equivalent) button/command, dialog may
  hang, using full CPU capacity and have to be killed. This does not
  seem to be an sbopkg issue.

  Workaround: use dialog's own exit methods - its buttons, escape, ^C,
  etc.

* When checking for updates, for some packages sbopkg may tell you
  "Note: repo version not obtainable by standard method, may be
  inaccurate.". This happens with packages whose version is very
  difficult/impossible to determine without actually building the
  package -- one example of this at the time of writing is the
  google-chrome package, whose version is picked from the source archive
  itself. In these cases sbopkg falls back to trusting the .info file,
  and warns the user about it.

  Workaround: none needed

* While you are free to set PAGER to any value you like, be aware that
  some pagers and settings may cause unexpected behavior. An example is
  if paging less than a screenful of output from the uninstalled
  packages option - the default pager 'more' will exit, displaying the
  packages and a prompt. 'less' may prompt for exit and clear its output
  on exit. Setting the environment variable LESS to include the F and X
  options will make less behave more like more in this instance. Other
  pagers may have other behaviors and other means of configuration.

  Workaround: pager-specific

* In Slackware 13.1 and earlier and sbopkg 0.33.2 and earlier, sbopkg
  would initially fail to download SlackBuilds only available through
  https. With more recent versions of sbopkg, it will offer to retry
  with certificate checking temporarily disabled and should then
  succeed. With more recent versions of Slackware, everything should
  Just Work unless there is an issue with 'self-signed' certificates or
  the like. Then the prompt to disable should still work.

  Workaround: In Slackware 13.1 and earlier, the best step, in many
  cases, is to install 'openssl-certs' from SBo, though this will not
  help for 'self-signed' certificates which will still trigger the
  prompt. To avoid it altogether you can permanently turn off
  certificate checking by adding '--no-check-certificate' to WGETFLAGS
  in sbopkg.conf.

* Certain packages build kernel modules and need to (re)set the ARCH to
  'x86' on i?86 (32-bit) systems which may result in packages with 'x86'
  as the ARCH in the file name, while sbopkg will display the specific
  ARCH of your system (or the ARCH you've set) in certain cases, such as
  in widget titles.

  Workaround: none needed

* When using sbopkg to sync to SBo git repositories (which is possible
  but unsupported) unexpected results may occur.

* When using the sbopkg bash completion file, 'sbopkg -V <TAB>' produces
  only branches as output rather than 'repo/branch'es. Currently, this
  works fine (just as if you typed 'sbopkg -V branch' yourself) but
  means you need to know which branches go to which repos. Also, it
  might have been more convenient to drop this in /etc/bash_completion.d
  but the full Slackware bash completion package (in extra) had an
  sbopkg completion file and may again someday and placing it in
  doc/contrib avoids any namespace or loading collisions.

  Workaround: none needed
