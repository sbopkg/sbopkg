ABOUT

    Sbopkg (pronounced 's-b-o-package') is a command-line and
    menu-based tool to synchronize with the SlackBuilds.org ('SBo')
    repository, a collection of third-party SlackBuild scripts to build
    Slackware packages. Sbopkg can also synchronize with any repository
    with an SBo-compatible hierarchy, including a locally-maintained
    repository.

    Sbopkg will allow the user to create, synchronize, search, and
    browse a copy of the active repository (currently, the size of a
    local copy of the SBo repository is xxxSIZExxx), read the ChangeLog
    (if available), list the installed SBo packages, display potential
    updates to SlackBuilds.org packages, view the README, SlackBuild,
    .info, and slack-desc and other files for each package, and make
    manual edits to a copy of the original .info or SlackBuild files.
    Sbopkg will also allow the user to select packages to build and it
    will download the source code, check the md5sum and GPG signature,
    build a Slackware package, and optionally install the package. The
    user can also download, optionally build, and optionally install
    more than one package by using the 'queue' feature. Sbopkg will not
    check dependencies since that is not a feature native to Slackware,
    but since the queue will process packages in the order listed, it is
    possible to build and install dependencies in order prior to
    building and installing the final, desired package.

    Sbopkg can also be used strictly from the command line without the
    dialog(1)-provided menu interface to do most of the above items.
    Typing 'sbopkg -h' will display the command line options.
