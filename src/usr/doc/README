ABOUT

Sbopkg (pronounced s-b-o-package) is a command-line and dialog-based tool to
synchronize with the SlackBuilds.org ("SBo") repository, a collection of
third-party SlackBuild scripts to build Slackware packages.  Sbopkg can also
synchronize with certain third-party repositories or access a
locally-maintained repository.

Sbopkg will allow the user to create, synchronize, search, and browse a copy
of the active repository (currently, the size of a local copy of the SBo
repository is about 70MB), read the ChangeLog (if available), list the
installed SBo packages, display potential updates to SlackBuilds.org packages,
view the README, SlackBuild, .info, and slack-desc files for each package, and
make manual edits to a copy of the original .info or SlackBuild files.  Sbopkg
will also allow the user to select packages to build and it will download the
source code, check the md5sum, build a Slackware package, and, optionally
install the package.  The user can also build, and optionally install, more
than one package by using the 'build queue' feature.  Sbopkg will not check
dependencies since that is not a feature native to Slackware, but since the
build queue will process packages in the order listed, it sometimes may be
possible to build and install dependencies in order prior to building and
installing the final, desired package.  Given the nature of building
dependencies, however, this probably will not always work and is not really a
supported feature.  Ultimately, Sbopkg is one thing and one thing only: a
medium to easily browse a local copy of the SlackBuilds.org and certain other
repositories and build packages from them.

Sbopkg can be also be used strictly from the command line without the
dialog interface to do most of the above items.  Typing sbopkg -h
will display the command line options.

HELP

Sbopkg comes with two man pages:  sbopkg.conf(5) and sbopkg(8).  These
man pages are kept up-to-date with functional changes in the script
itself, so they are a good source of information on how to use sbopkg.

If the man pages are not sufficient, please consider joining the sbopkg
mailing list and posting your question there.  You should be able to
subscribe by sending mail to sbopkg-users-request@sbopkg.org whose body
is 'subscribe your-email@address-here'. There is also an IRC channel for
sbopkg on Freenode at #sbopkg.  Further information on all of these
resources is on the project's website at http://www.sbopkg.org - click
the "Docs/Help" tab.

CONTRIBUTORS

We welcome bug reports, suggestions, patches, or feature requests.
Please post any of these to the Issue tracker (kind of like a
Bugzilla) on the project's Google page (click the Issues tab) at
http://code.google.com/p/sbopkg so we can keep track of them.  There
have been many contributors so far, and they are all mentioned near
the top of the sbopkg script itself.  Thanks to everyone who has
helped make this script better.
