sbopkg 0.37.0 (2013-12-09 15:10 UTC)

    FEATURES

        * This release of sbopkg is Slackware 14.1-ready. Congrats to
          the entire Slackware team for another great release!
        * Sbopkg now has a -B flag which will allow the user to
	  process the queue from the command line in 'bulk' without
	  confirmation first.

    MODIFICATIONS

        * No other modifications have been made.

sbopkg 0.36.0 (2012-10-04 03:05 UTC)

    FEATURES

        * This release of sbopkg is Slackware 14.0-ready. (Congrats to
          all involved in the Slackware release.)
        * Sbopkg now has a -d flag which can download without building
          or installing, in addition to -b (download, build) and -i
          (download, build, install). Thanks to Kristoffer Karlsson for
          the feature request and some testing and to Mauro Giachero for
          the initial patch and discussion and review of additional
          patching.
        * It is now possible to combine the -r flag with other flags
          such that a sync is performed first. For example 'sbopkg -ri
          foo' will synchronize with the repo and install the latest
          foo.
        * There is a new configuration option, NICE, which enables the
          user to specify a niceness for the execution of the
          SlackBuild. Previously, this was hardcoded to 10 (which is
          still the default). Thanks to Joni Martikainen for the
          suggestion.

    MODIFICATIONS

        * Specifying an alternate directory as repository root from the
          command line, which was done with the -d flag, is now done
          with the -D flag. Sorry for any inconvenience.
        * The 'Build' option in a package's info menu has been renamed
          to 'Process', along with many other minor informational
          changes throughout the UI.
        * The Slamd64 repo file has been removed as that project is
          defunct.

sbopkg 0.35.0 (2011-04-28 02:48 UTC)

    FEATURES

        * This release of sbopkg is Slackware 13.37-ready. (Congrats to
          all involved in the Slackware release.)

        * The READMEs of all installed packages can now be read from the
          main menu's list/uninstall item. (Selection state will also
          now be remembered.) Thanks to dmotaleite for the RFE.

        * Similarly, the -R and -p flags can now be combined to page
          through the READMEs of all installed packages.

        * Added ponce's repo (SBo variant for -current) to the default
          repos. Thanks to Mauro for suggesting this about a year ago.
          Note that this is unsupported (if a build from this repo
          breaks in sbopkg you get to keep both pieces) but people seem
          pleased with this repo and it'll save a step for new users.
          Note that the default repo files have been reordered, as well.
          50-sb64 is now 70, 60-local is now 50, and the new one is 60.
          This puts the unsupported repos last. If by chance you have a
          file with those names already in there, upgrading sbopkg will
          clobber them. See each of the two following sections for more
          repo-related modifications and bugfixing.

        * Added a bash completion file for sbopkg. This is independent
          of the bash-completion package. It can be found in the new
          doc/contrib directory. Source the file (in your shell startup
          files if you want it always on automatically) from its current
          location or wherever you wish to copy it and you should be
          able to complete some of sbopkg's flags and their arguments.
          Also see the KNOWN_ISSUES file. Thanks to Sergey V. for this
          contribution.

    MODIFICATIONS

        * Updated French man pages. Thanks to Marie-Claude Collilieux.

        * Revised documentation: moved the queuefiles directory into a
          new contrib directory, renamed the README-*.d documents,
          stripping the '.d'. Clarified/updated the dialog nav/certcheck
          sections of KNOWN_ISSUES, brought the missing 0.27.0 and
          0.33.1 branch changes from their ChangeLogs into NEWS, added a
          block in README describing all the plain text documents, added
          a note about making corrections to THANKS, a couple of TODO
          items, etc.

        * Note also that symlinks are now made from README-repos and
          README-renames to READMEs in the corresponding /etc/sbopkg/*.d
          directories. NOTE that renames files must now end in .renames
          so, if you have custom files in renames.d, you'll need to
          rename them.

        * The 'Choose a repository' dialog widget is now titled
          'Repository Selection' and the widget text was revised. Also,
          the menu itself used to say 'BRANCH (REPO) DESCRIPTION' and
          now says 'REPO (BRANCH) DESCRIPTION'. The relevant item in the
          Utilities menu that shows which repo/branch you're on and
          takes you to the Repository Selection widget was similarly
          re-ordered.

        * When a repository directory does not exist, sbopkg now
          displays, e.g.

          REPO_{ROOT,NAME,BRANCH} -> /var/lib/sbopkg/,SBo/,13.1

          or, in the case of git repos which don't currently have BRANCH
          directories, it just shows REPO_{ROOT,NAME}. It used to
          display

          REPO_ROOT -----------> /var/lib/sbopkg/

          While the new line may be odd looking, it should be clear
          enough that it means REPO_ROOT is /var/lib/sbopkg/, REPO_NAME
          is SBo/ and REPO_BRANCH is 13.1 and that these are path
          components and that the path is missing. Before, it would say
          /var/lib/sbopkg/ didn't exist if, e.g., 13.1 was missing even
          when /var/lib/sbopkg/ did exist.

    BUGFIXES

        * Fixed an issue where URL redirects and SSL certificate check
          failures could combine to cause a download failure. Thanks to
          vbatts for raising this issue.

        * Fixed a documentation bug where the ability to keep a
          ~/.sbopkg.conf file to override the system config file (since
          0.25.0) wasn't documented anywhere other than this file. It's
          now in both manuals. Thanks to Bill Kirkpatrick for raising
          this issue.

        * Fixed an issue where 'Invert all' in file removal dialogs
          didn't 'invert' but turned everything on or off, regardless of
          selection state. If it was really intended to be
          'Select/Deselect all', then changing the button to "Invert
          Sel" and making it do that was a feature/modification instead
          of a bugfix. ;)

        * Fixed an issue were the user could switch repos, receive a
          directory creation prompt, abort it, and the active repo would
          be switched anyway, despite the directory not being created.
          Now, the original repo is restored as the active one.

        * Fixed a bug in a previous bugfix that would still let sbopkg
          download source files whose DOWNLOAD value ended in
          '/download' even when the source files were cached.

        * Fixed a depth-restriction bug triggered when an app
          directory's subdirectory has the same name as another app
          directory, causing sbopkg to match things or try to use things
          like openvswitch/xen/foo when xen/foo is intended. Thanks to
          David Somero for reporting this.

sbopkg 0.34.1 (2011-02-05 04:20 UTC)

    FEATURES

        * Added Spanish translations of the man pages. Much thanks to
          Pablo Castano Fernandez for doing these translations.

    MODIFICATIONS

        * Revision of documentation. Major reformatting and some textual
          modifications of /usr/doc/sbopkg-*/* including breaking out
          the credits in the script into a detailed THANKS file,
          renaming and reformatting ChangeLog.txt into NEWS, renaming
          the sample queuefiles from *.sqf to *.sqf.sample, and making
          lesser modifications to all the other docs.

    BUGFIXES

        * Fixed issue where MKDIR_PROMPT was being ignored. Thanks to
          catkin for raising this issue.

        * Fixed issue where -o would wrongly produce no output. Thanks
          to ArTourter for raising this issue and to Mauro Giachero for
          the patch.

        * Fixed issue where TAG would sometimes not appear in the final
          package. Thanks to chytraeus for raising this issue.

        * A revision which fixed a failure to properly initialize
          directories when running under bash 3x was committed but
          didn't make it into the released package. It is included in
          this release. Also fixed a problem with a blank line being
          wrongly displayed in the directory initialization output in
          older bashes. Thanks to greinze for pointing the latter out.

        * Fixed documentation bug where the obsolete SBOPKGTMP and
          current TMPDIR variables weren't correctly documented. Thanks
          to dive for raising this issue.

        * Fixed non-documentation bug where TMPDIR wasn't being
          correctly assigned when set in sbopkg.conf. Thanks to Ken
          Roberts for reporting the issue and providing a preliminary
          fix.

sbopkg 0.34.0 (2010-11-12 03:37 UTC)

    * Revised man pages - these are very different and now document a
      couple of previously undocumented things and are worth a
      (re-)read. Thanks to Marie-Claude Collilieux for the French
      translations of these.

    * The HACKING file now includes a man page style guide in addition
      to the coding style guide.

    * The LOGDIR variable has been removed from sbopkg.conf - DIR can be
      specified in LOGFILE.

    * The DEBUG variable has been renamed to DEBUG_UPDATES in
      sbopkg.conf.

    * The default timeout values in {WGET,RSYNC}FLAGS have been raised
      from 10/15 to 30 in sbopkg.conf.

    * All parameters in sbopkg.conf now use default values only if the
      variable hasn't been previously set (meaning they can all be
      overridden by passing variables on the command line).

    * sbopkg.conf has been reordered - this may make any merging that
      may be needed more interesting this time but hopefully it's worth
      it.

    * The directory initialization process has been changed - at first
      run or otherwise when encountering missing directories, the user
      will now be presented with a single list of them and a
      (C)reate/(A)bort prompt.

    * The command line user interface has been overhauled in terms of
      more consistent validated command line messages and prompts.

    * Fix an ARCH display issue in the updates screen; thanks to
      alkos333, Marc Payne, and David Spencer for confirming the issue
      and thanks to David Spencer for testing the fix.

    * Fixed bugs with dzen2 and *zarafa* not downloading/building
      properly. Note that, while the changes fix these issues and should
      make it easier to handle similar problems in the future, this
      change may introduce regressions. If a download or build fails due
      to a downloaded tarball looking something like
      'blah?actual_tarball.tar.gz' or the like, please report it to us.

    * Fixed bugs with the '-s' option where only the first of multiple
      arguments would be returned and where the command line select menu
      was broken. Also where it and the -g flag might inadvertently
      expand globs wrongly.

    * It's now possible to specify the b,g,i,s flags multiple times.
      Previously multiple arguments to these flags had to be quoted (-b
      "foo bar") but now they can be given as '-b foo -b bar'. The
      original style is still supported.

    * With the new style of passing multiple arguments, it is now
      possible to specify app-specific options on the command line.
      These take the form of, e.g., '-i app1:opt1="foo bar":opt2=baz
      app2:opt=mu'. If that's cryptic, see the manual for details.

    * Users now have the option of interactively retrying a failed https
      download, invoking wget with '--no-check-certificate', as this can
      be caused by 'self-signed certificates' and the like.

sbopkg 0.33.2 (2010-07-20 02:10 UTC)

    * fix security issue involving unsafe creation of temp{dir,file}

sbopkg 0.33.1 (2010-05-27 18:13 UTC)

    * The ARCH assignment was modified to accord with the latest SBo
      SlackBuild template.

    * Tweaked widgets in select_repository() (no or less scrolling) and
      load_user_queue() (better button) and modified check_gpg() to not
      disrupt the dialog interface with gpg output

    * Revised the KNOWN_ISSUES file and other documentation

sbopkg 0.33.0 (2010-05-24 20:53 UTC)

    * Addressed an apparent bash 4.1 bug that causes the 'obsolete
      sources' function to break.

    * Addressed issue 44 where hitting ^C during the download of part of
      a queue and restarting the queue could result in a download
      failure. Thanks to slava18 for the report.

    * Changed the menu order of the "Build options" dialog to default to
      using "Saved" options rather than "None".

    * Fixed issue 45 where packages with '+' in the name were not
      properly detected in some cases. Thanks to skalkoto for the
      report.

    * Added a help item to the main menu of the dialog interface with
      pointers to documentation and other resources.

    * Added an option to print the version of sbopkg. We try not to
      change the meaning of flags but note that this does change what
      was the '-v' flag to '-V' and now uses '-v' for its customary
      'version' purpose. Note that the new -V flag now accepts a '?'
      argument (sbopkg -V ?) which will display the list of valid
      repositories.

    * Tweak the logic re determining ARCH and modify some ARCH-related
      evals and conditionals in check_for_updates and info_item.

    * Fixed a bug which could result in some sources being missed when
      checking for obsolete sources.

    * Added a command line option '-P' to access the 'remove uninstalled
      packages' function which had previously only been accessible from
      the dialog interface.

    * Miscellaneous tweaks in preparation for release and to bring in
      line with Slackware 13.1.

sbopkg 0.32.0 (2010-03-05 21:29 UTC)

    * Add several renames to 50-default renames file.

    * Add support for UNSUPPORTED/UNTESTED packages in the SBo repo;
      thanks to artourter for the bug report.

    * Honor the TAG exported by the user; thanks to Matteo Bernardini
      for the feature request.

    * Fix issue where delete sources in package info item menu did not
      work in some cases; thanks to artourter for the report, thanks to
      slakmagik for the hard work in fixing this and thanks to Mauro for
      the review and suggestions.

    * Add the ability to skip the prompts for sbopkg's directory
      creations via the new config file option MKDIR_PROMPT. This is
      useful, for example, if you have some SBo/sbopkg directories on a
      temporary filesystem and don't want to be bothered with repeated
      directory creation prompts. Thanks to agikhan for the report.

    * Address an issue where sbopkg could sometimes pick an older
      package to present for installation rather than the most recent
      one; thanks to artourter for the report.

    * Prevent sbopkg from spitting error messages when trying to
      determine the version of some packages (e.g. google-chrome, whose
      version is discovered looking into the source package which can be
      missing). Thanks to alkos333 for the bug report.

    * Add ability to temporarily change $ARCH in the 'options' submenu.

sbopkg 0.31.0 (2009-11-01 02:54 UTC)

    * Fix typo in 50-default renames file.

    * Fix the "Uncheck installed" feature. The code apparently worked
      fine even without the fix. Spotted by slakmagik.

    * Add $ARCH information in dialog backtitles.

    * Add ":force" to sbopkg.conf WGETFLAGS --progress=bar to correctly
      display the wget progress bar; thanks to happyslacker for nudging
      me on this issue again.

    * Fix an issue with the build options dialog menu where selecting
      'None' would not work; thanks to happyslacker for the bug report.

    * Add the ability to uninstall SBo packages from the dialog
      interface that lists installed packages. Thanks to pokipoki08 for
      the suggestion.

    * Fix an incompatibility regarding the way bash 3.1, 3.2, and 4.0
      handle the RHS of [[ commands using the =~ operator which broke
      the repo file validation, among other things. Thanks to SiegeX,
      Zmyrgel, and BCarey for the reports and suggestions.

    * Add the ability to run multiple sbopkg instances simultaneously.
      This has been suggested many times in the past. Users should read
      the sbopkg.conf man page before using this option (which is
      disabled by default).

    * Be more strict validating YES/NO configuration variables.

    * Add a KNOWN_ISSUES file - if you encounter a bug, check this file
      before reporting it to see if it's known and if there's a
      workaround.

    * Modify sspm to be root-only and change the default checkout
      location. In case it isn't obvious, this means the checkout will
      be root-owned if it isn't already.

    * Fix cosmetic bug where ARCH and BUILD were not displaying
      correctly in list of updates on x86_64.

    * Add a dialog and cli option to show all READMEs for the queued
      packages. This can come handy to do "final checks" on the active
      queue before starting the build process.

    * Reworked the options selection menu to avoid seeing only a
      truncated set of the actual options; thanks to Erik Hanson for the
      bug report.

    * Work around build issues caused by custom LC_COLLATE values.

    * Add tint=tint2 to /etc/sbopkg/renames.d/50-default file.

    * Prevent an infinite download loop by modifying get_source() and
      check_source(); make sure that we do try to guess about the file
      name in a DOWNLOAD/filename mismatch but only when we absolutely
      have to, by modifying get_source_names(). Thanks to godling for
      noticing the problem.

    * The 'check for updates' function now always lists apparent
      downgrades, since it sometimes can mistakenly classify an upgrade
      as a downgrade (e.g. version 1.0.1 looks older than 1.0-rc2 to
      sbopkg). The apparent downgrades are added to the queue but are
      disabled by default.

sbopkg 0.30.1 (2009-08-28 17:34 UTC)

    * Fix the updates code for the 13.0 repo; thanks to everybody who
      contacted us about this issue.

    * Fix the $SBOPKGTMP sanity check. Thanks to Ken Roberts for raising
      the issue.

    * Update the renames file.

sbopkg 0.30.0 (2009-08-24 17:28 UTC)

    * Move sbopkg to /usr/sbin; update sbopkg.SlackBuild and sspm to
      reflect /usr/sbin.

    * Change default directory paths in sbopkg.conf.new; add new
      variable SBOPKGTMP, which will be used to store sbopkg-related
      temp files; also add new variable LOGDIR which will contain any
      sbopkg-related log files.

    * Remove code related to user-mode support; sbopkg must now be run
      as root in all cases; add single check at start of script to make
      sure we are root.

    * Apply a major code cleanup that touches just about every part of
      sbopkg. This cleanup makes the code more readable, manageable, and
      less bug-prone. Several bugs were fixed as part of this cleanup,
      and the cleanup will ease further development and debugging
      efforts.

    * Remove some useless code from check_for_latest and also fix the
      download folder for sbopkg updates.  Thanks to David Somero for
      the bug report.

    * Re-implement the code that checks for renamed software; fix
      upgrading of renamed packages; thanks to Phillip Warner for
      raising the issues with the older code; thanks to Mauro Giachero
      for working on these fixes.

    * Fix a tr invocation issue where in certain instances, sbopkg would
      not run from certain directories; thanks to Marie-Claude
      Collilieux for the bug report.

    * Alter sed expression in download code to work around calcurse
      filename idiosyncrasy; thanks to Glenn Becker for the bug report.

    * Move French man pages into correct /usr/man/fr* location and
      remove them from the /docs directory; update French man pages;
      thanks to Marie-Claude Collilieux.

    * Remove a stale 'find' call, which slightly improves the update
      feature.

    * Add acroread->adobe-reader, GNOME-Colors->gnome-colors,
      wbxml2->libwbxml and museek-plus->museek+ renames.

    * Display a message when no packages are installed instead of doing
      nothing.

    * Properly quote the current working directory variable in the event
      there are spaces in the directory name.

    * Fix a bug where 'sbopkg -c -v local' would display a dialog even
      though running in cli mode.

    * Fix issue where the 'games' directory was non-browsable due to a
      slack-desc file containing double-quotes in the first line; thanks
      to Glenn Becker for the original bug report.

    * Implement configurable repository support by introducing a new
      /etc/sbopkg/repos.d directory where separate repositories files
      can be maintained and also by adding support for git-based
      repositories.  The Slamd64Builds repository is now listed, to the
      joy of all the Slamd64 users out there.  Add a new document
      README-repos.d that explains how these repository files work.

    * 'Nice' the build process so as to improve sbopkg's resource
      utilization.

    * Fix a few issues regarding user sbopkg.conf files.

    * Move sbopkg-renames to new /etc/sbopkg/renames.d/50-default to
      manage multiple renames files.  Thanks to Robby Workman for the
      suggestion. Add new document README-renames.d that explains how
      this works.

    * Add support for new *.txz, *.tlz, and *.tbz Slackware package
      extensions.

    * Rewrite several portions of the process_queue function in order to
      properly handle certain items by the caller; clean up and improve
      the logging displayed during the build process.

    * Require build queuefiles have a '.sqf' file extension.

    * Add a sanity check for files in sbopkg's temp directory.

    * Cleanup several of the functions related to editing the .info and
      SlackBuild files to remove code duplication; also cleanup and fix
      issues associated with the two primary search functions, and
      improve file cleanup for these search-related functions.

    * Fix issue where MD5SUM checking would fail when certain upstream
      packages do not change source file name on version updates by
      adding in an extra check for existing sources.  Additionally, add
      an option to retry a source download in the event of an MD5SUM
      failure to avoid having to restart a build.  Thanks to David
      Spencer for raising these issues and thanks to Mauro Giachero for
      the fixes and improvements.

    * Create a ChangeLog.txt for git repos on the fly.

    * Remove usage of ARCH in preparation for Slackware64 support.

    * Remove obsolete load_backup_queue.

    * Improve and fix some issues with the search functions and leaking
      variables.

    * Change queuefile format.  No longer will the queuefile format be
      'APP VERSION ON/OFF' but instead will simply be one 'APP' per
      line.  If a user wants an APP to be deselected in the dialog
      menus, simply put a '-' in front of it, e.g. '-APP'.  This should
      make creating, using, and sharing queuefiles much easier and more
      intuitive.

    * Add ability to load more than one queuefile at a time when
      building from command line interface.

    * The info_item dialog now shows non-SBo installed packages and
      gained a more robust approach to finding both the installed
      package names and the available packages in $OUTPUT.

    * Add ability to dump all installed packages into a build queue.
      This is an alphabetical list, so shuffling/reordering of the queue
      will be necessary in order to list the dependencies correctly, but
      at least this will give users a head start on setting up a large
      build queue.

    * The process of searching for obsolete source archives can now be
      interrupted with ESC.

    * Add several new functions related to checking GPG-signed tarballs,
      such as those that SlackBuilds.org provides.  Sbopkg will now
      automatically check these tarballs when building or installing a
      package. Additionally, there are two new menu items in info_item
      that allow the user to check the GPG signature or re-extract the
      GPG-signed tarball.

    * Add ability to have recursive queuefiles, so one queuefile named
      "foo.sqf" may have an entry "@bar" in which case as the foo.sqf
      queuefile is parsed, it will recursively go down into the
      'bar.sqf' queuefile as well.  The '@' symbol is used in front of
      an entry in a queuefile to denote another queuefile.

    * Remove the old "$APP $VERSION$BUILD $ONOFF" format for the
      temporary queue and instead make all queue formats "$APP" only.
      This simplifies some code and results in a small speed increase.

    * Exit edit_build_queue menu with 'ESC'; thanks to Nille for the bug
      report.

    * Modify do_install() to correctly invoke upgradepkg to avoid a
      fairly rare but serious case of removing the wrong package; thanks
      to NaCl for the bug report.

    * Add ability to pass build options in a queuefile when separated by
      a pipe character, i.e. app | FOO=yes BAR=no means app will be
      built with FOO and BAR build options set as indicated.

    * Fix rare issue where incorrect file was upgraded; thanks to
      neonflux for the bug report.

    * Fix issue where custom build options may not be correctly
      exported.

    * Add a 'diff' entry to the script customization menu.

    * Add in 'uname -m' test for x86_64 and if so, set ARCH to x86_64.

    * Set default SBo repo to 13.0; add 13.0 repo to
      /etc/sbopkg/repos.d/40-sbo.repo.

    * Add support for multiple architectures and multiple source files.
      This makes sbopkg able to handle the new features that
      SlackBuilds.org admins are preparing for the Slackware 13.0
      release.

    * Add option to retry a failed build. Thanks to Zordrak for
      suggesting this feature.

    * Add CLEANUP configuration variable, which when set to YES tells
      sbopkg to delete the extracted sources, and all the associated
      "residuals" of the build, as soon as the build is finished. Thanks
      to Marco Bonetti and Gregory Tourte for the suggestion and the
      nice discussion.

    * Add a function to delete obsolete (not installed) packages from
      $OUTPUT. Thanks to alkos333 for the idea.

    * Reorganize the queue editing functions a bit for a better user
      interface; 'view queue' now only shows the queue; new 'sort' and
      'remove' queue menu items now handle the editing functions; thanks
      to Pierre Cazenave for the suggestion.

    * Add dialog notification of whether a queued package is installed.

    * Add a dialog option to automatically uncheck installed packages
      from the active queue, together with a command line option -k that
      automatically skips such packages when building with -b or -i.

    * Add ability to 'invert' all selected/deselected in the clear cache
      and obsolete sources and packages dialogs; thanks to dive for the
      suggestion.

sbopkg 0.27.4 (2009-06-24 16:13 UTC)

    * Fix rare issue where incorrect file was upgraded; thanks to neonflux for
      the bug report.

    * Fix issue where custom build options may not be correctly exported.

    * Improve cleanup after building or installing a package.

sbopkg 0.27.3 (2009-06-15 00:51 UTC)

    * Add museek-plus->museek+ to sbopkg-renames.new.

    * Modify the source fetching code to check the md5sum also of cached
      sources, to fix problems arising with those programs whose source archive
      doesn't change name on version updates. Thanks to David Spencer for
      raising the issue.

    * Exit edit_build_queue menu with 'ESC'; thanks to Nille for the bug report.

    * Modify do_install() to correctly invoke upgradepkg to avoid a fairly rare
      but serious case of removing the wrong package; thanks to NaCl for the
      bug report.

sbopkg 0.27.2 (2009-04-30 14:36 UTC)

    * Remove a stale 'find' call, which slightly improves the update feature.

    * Add acroread->adobe-reader and GNOME-Colors->gnome-colors to
      sbopkg-renames.new.

    * Display a message when no packages are installed instead of doing nothing.

    * Properly quote the current working directory variable in the event there
      are spaces in the directory name.

    * Fix a bug where 'sbopkg -c -v local' would display a dialog even though
      running in cli mode.

    * Fix issue where the 'games' directory was non-browsable due to a
      slack-desc file containing double-quotes in the first line; thanks to
      Glenn Becker for the original bug report.

sbopkg 0.27.1 (2009-04-07 13:32 UTC)

    * Remove some useless code from check_for_latest and also fix the
      download folder for sbopkg updates.  Thanks to David Somero for the bug
      report.

    * Re-implement the code that checks for renamed software; fix upgrading
      of renamed packages; thanks to Phillip Warner for raising the issues
      with the older code; add wbxml2->libwbxml to sbopkg-renames; thanks to
      Mauro Giachero for working on these fixes.

    * Fix a tr invocation issue where in certain instances, sbopkg would not run
      from certain directories; thanks to Marie-Claude Collilieux for the bug
      report.

    * Alter sed expression in download code to work around calcurse filename
      idiosyncrasy; thanks to Glenn Becker for the bug report.

    * Move French man pages into correct /usr/man/fr* location and remove them
      from the /docs directory; update French man pages; thanks to
      Marie-Claude Collilieux.

    * Fix a problem with the Pre-Check Log dialog being non-scrollable and
      having a visual glitch. Thanks to Erik Hanson for the bug report.

    * Remove a problem where the "Using the queuefile QUEUEFILE" messages could
      be incorrect.

    * Fix a possible infinite loop when building in CLI mode.

    * Fix an issue with an ncurses check and the cleanup() function.

sbopkg 0.27.0 (2009-02-26 14:48 UTC)

    * Commit a patch that adds a new sbopkg.conf configuration variable,
      QUEUEDIR, where users can define where saved queues are stored;
      also, when the user wants to load a saved queue, show a list of
      available saved queues; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.

    * Add ability to search for keywords in the README files using
      regular expressions; this new 'string search' can also be narrowed
      to only search installed packages; thanks to slakmagik for the
      original patch and implementation and thanks to both slakmagik and
      Mauro Giachero for cleaning it up and addressing minor issues
      before the commit.

    * Commit a cleanup/misc patch from slakmagik that removes some
      useless code and fixes some style issues; thanks to slakmagik for
      the patch.

    * Allow user to interrupt/abort the update progressbar by pressing
      ESC; thanks to Mauro Giachero for the feature.

    * Assorted menu navigation fixes, and document -p switch in
      sbopkg(8) man page; thanks to Mauro Giachero for these
      improvements.

    * Add ability to view a diff of an edited .info or SlackBuild file
      before choosing which one to use; this feature adds two
      configuration variables to the sbopkg.conf file: DIFF and
      DIFFOPTS; thanks to Phillip Warner for the suggestion and thanks
      to Mauro Giachero for helping debug/improve my original
      implemenation.

    * Add ability to view more files in each application's folder, i.e.
      doinst.sh, or *.desktop files; thanks to Phillip Warner for the
      suggestion and thanks to slakmagik for the patch implementing this
      feature.

    * Rework the check for root:root permissions when installing
      packages; now, if the package does not have root:root permissions,
      sbopkg will display the output of ls -l <packagename> and ask if
      the user wishes to install or abort, rather than only aborting.

    * Allow the usage of the -d, -f and -v command-line options in
      dialog mode, and output an error message when the command line
      contains unrecognized tokens.

    * Move the -q option to -g (general search) in order to make way for
      -q, 'quiet mode' where the output of some of the command line
      options (i.e. the command line progressbar) can be minimized.
      More quieting will likely occur in future releases.  Thanks to
      alkos333 for the feature request.

    * Implement a workaround so that the dialog interface now works
      better with GNU Screen and rxvt-based terminals. Thanks to Phillip
      Warner for raising the issue and thanks to Mauro Giachero for
      working on the implementation.

    * Include a French translation of the two sbopkg man pages.  For
      now, these man pages will be included in the /doc directory until
      I have time to figure out whether they can be automatically
      installed in place of the English ones depending on a locale
      setting.  In any event, I would like to extend my thanks to
      Marie-Claude Collilieux for providing this first translation for
      sbopkg.  I am sure folks will appreciate the work she put into it.
      If anyone else wants to follow her lead and provide some other
      translations, I would be happy to include them.  Thanks
      Marie-Claude!

    * Add in several patches from slakmagik that lets the user choose
      from saved queues, modifies how the saved queues and backup queues
      work, and modifies several other queue-related functions and
      menus.  Many thanks to slakmagik for his continually excellent
      contributions.

    * Implement an 'autoqueue' by allowing the user to specify queue
      names to '-b' and '-i' and by adding a -e option whereby the user
      can specify what to do on errors (stop, ask, or continue).  Thanks
      to Alan Hicks for suggesting this feature and thanks to Mauro
      Giachero for the implementation.

sbopkg 0.26.2 (2009-01-30 23:03 UTC)

    * Fix regression where packages could not be installed in certain
      instances.  Thanks to artourter for the bug report.

sbopkg 0.26.1 (2009-01-30 04:21 UTC)

    * Implement some security fixes, namely, customize the output of
      some of the menus so only things that can be done as root (i.e.
      build, install, process the queue) are seen by the root user; also
      add a check to make sure only root can install packages and that
      packages are correctly set with root:root permissions.  Thanks to
      Phillip Warner for the report and suggestions.

    * Modify SLACKVER in sbopkg.conf so it can be passed at runtime to
      sbopkg. Thanks to TSquaredF for the suggestion.

    * Quiet down the number of messages displayed when updated items are
      added to the queue; thanks to Phillip Warner for the suggestion.

    * Fix issue where sometimes duplicate items would appear in the
      search results dialog; thanks to Phillip Warner for the
      suggestion.

sbopkg 0.26.0 (2009-01-29 14:41 UTC)

    * Add in new update code by Mauro Giachero.  This /greatly/ improves
      how the updates are handled and virtually eliminates the need for
      specific application quirks.  Please note there is a new file
      /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg-renames that handles a few name changes.  If
      you upgrade sbopkg with the new package, then this file will be
      automatically installed.  If not, you'll need to grab this file
      from the source tarball and move it there manually.  Many thanks
      to Mauro for the hard work in finally getting the update code done
      right.  :-)

    * Change how selecting/unselecting items in the build queue are
      handled. Now, when items are unselected, they remain in the queue
      but are turned "OFF" and when the queue is processed, only those
      packages turned "ON" will be built or installed.

    * Improve how packages are added to the queue.  The user is now
      prompted if they want to replace items already in the queue or
      skip them.  This may be helpful if a user has saved a queue with
      lots of dependencies that are then updated through the rsync
      process.  The updates can be added to the queue, replacing the old
      versions.

    * Add in a nice progress gauge when running the update list rather
      than the warning message.  Thanks to alkos333 for the idea and
      initial implementation, and thanks to Mauro Giachero for working
      on the CLI version.

    * Merge in a large whitespace/cleanup patch by slakmagik which
      greatly improves the readability of the code; thanks to slakmagik
      for the patch.

    * Replace the 'Clear Queue' menu item with 'Delete Queue Items'
      which provides the user the ability to delete individual items in
      the queue or clear the entire build queue.

    * Add in ability to have a /local directory in the local SBo
      repository tree on a user's system that is in parallel with other
      SBo directories (i.e. /home/sbo/local).  As long as this directory
      is maintained in an SBo style (including user-defined categories),
      then sbopkg will pick them up and the user can change their
      SLACKVER to 'local' and build/install packages from there.  This
      might be useful in testing pre-submissions to SBo or for
      maintaining other software not in SBo. This was inspired by a
      similar idea contributed by slakmagik.  Please see the
      sbopkg.conf(5) man page for more information.

    * Commit a patch from slakmagik that adds a new sbopkg.conf variable
      LOGFILE where the user can decide the name and location of the
      permanent build log, if used; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.

    * Improve the configuration file handling so that sbopkg now runs
      even with a missing or deficient system-wide configuration file,
      as long as the user's ~/.sbopkg.conf file is present and fills the
      gaps.

    * Fix issue where downloaded sources with spaces in their file names
      would cause an MD5SUM failure; thanks to alkos333 for the bug
      report, and thanks to Mauro Giachero for improving my initial bug
      fix implementation.

    * Commit several other patches from slakmagik that improve the
      handling of the search box upon search failures; tweak the
      precheck log a bit; improve the checking of root privilegs, and
      improve the handling of the directory-creation checks; thanks to
      slakmagik for these patches.

    * Fix issue where a failed download would still go through an md5sum
      check; now it informs the user of the failed download and asks if
      the user wishes to continue with the build queue or abort.

    * Eliminate some redundant or annoying messages to the user, such as
      when the backup queue is saved.

    * Add 'sspm' utility script by slakmagik which makes mirroring the
      sbopkg SVN repository and making a package from the local SVN
      mirror very easy; this script is located in the /tools directory
      in the sbopkg SVN repository; thanks to slakmagik for the script.

    * Fix issue where ARCH would sometimes not get picked up in
      info_item menu (notably for OpenOffice.org); thanks to artourter
      for the bug report, and thanks to Mauro for the fix.

    * Lots of other internal 'under the hood' improvements to the
      repository browsing, directory check functionality, build queue,
      and just general overall code cleanup.

sbopkg 0.25.0 (2009-01-17 02:15 UTC)

    This is another version jump due to the number of fixes,
    enhancements, and new features.

    * Fix issue where packages were sometimes incorrectly identified as
      already being in the build queue when they were not; thanks to
      SpacePlod for the bug report and thanks to Mauro Giachero for
      further bug reporting and providing a patch to fix it.

    * Add ability to pass build options/flavors/arguments to the
      SlackBuild when using the dialog interface.

    * Include ability to reverse or manually sort the items in the build
      queue; thanks to Mauro Giachero for the patches to implement these
      features.

    * Move all the queue functions into a separate 'Manage Queue'
      submenu off the main menu.

    * Allow user to save (and load) the build queue between sessions by
      specifing a file and location, so multiple saved queues can be
      maintained.

    * Automatically backup the current queue upon exiting and offer to
      reload upon first entering the queue submenu.

    * Provide a menu entry to clear the build queue.

    * Merge in several patches from Mauro Giachero to display the SVN
      version number; clean up use of cancel/back and ESC (ESC now takes
      you back a step in most dialogs); improve the cleanup process; and
      improve the new build flavors/options dialog.

    * Apply several patches from slakmagik for various little fixes,
      cleanups, and tweaks.

    * Create a new 'Utilities' submenu off the main menu and move some
      of the less-important items there in order to clean up the main
      menu.  It was getting a bit bulky.  :-)

    * Add ability to download a new sbopkg package when there is an
      update.

    * Include optional use of a ~/.sbopkg.conf, which will override
      settings in the system /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf file.

    * When changing the Slackware version in the dialog interface, offer
      the user the opportunity to save this change in the new
      ~/.sbopkg.conf file.

    * Improve build queue logging and error reporting; correctly remove
      symlink to the source tarball when build fails.

    * Bump default wget timeout from 10 to 15 seconds which prevents
      some downloads from failing.

    * Add update list fix for ksmoothdock; thanks to Wade Grant for the
      bug report.

    * Improve how the sources are downloaded and identified.

    * Remove the 'read sbopkg README' from the main menu.

    * Add a directory check for OUTPUT since that is now required.

    * Add preliminary check to make sure command line options -b and -i
      are not used together.

    * Fix issue where certain packages in queue that end with a ++ (like
      libsigc++) could not be added.

sbopkg 0.20.0 (2009-01-01 20:53 UTC)

    This a version jump due to the numerous fixes, enhancements, and new
    features.

    New features:

        * There is a new -i command line switch that allows the user to
          build and install packages in a manner similar to the current
          -b switch for building only.  As with the -b switch, the user
          can build and install more than one package by listing them in
          quotes. And, by carefully listing dependencies in the right
          order, it might be possible to build and install dependencies
          and the final, target package in one go, like this:

          # sbopkg -i "imlib2 giblib feh"

          In this case, imlib2 must be built and installed before
          giblib, both of which need to be built and installed before
          feh. Given the nature of building dependencies, this may not
          always work, but it still may be helpful and useful in many
          cases.

        * Coupled with the new -i switch, there is a new 'build queue' in
          the dialog interface.  The user can add packages to the queue
          and then, when ready, can process the queue in the order the
          packages are listed.  The user can choose to build only or
          build and install the packages in the queue.  Again, by
          listing dependencies in the right order, it may be possible to
          build dependencies and the final, target package in one go
          like the feh example above.

        * After checking for updates, the user is offered the
          opportunity to add those flagged updates to the build queue
          automatically.

        * When building packages individually outside of the build
          queue, the user is offered the opportunity to build or build
          and install the package.

        * There is a new -u command line switch, and a corresponding new
          dialog menu selection, that allows the user to check if there
          is an update to sbopkg itself.

        * A new DEBUG variable is introduced to the sbopkg.conf file
          that allow for easier debugging and update list bug reporting.
          See the sbopkg.conf man page for more detail.

    Bug Fixes:

        * Fix issues with the "Installed/Not Installed" text at the top
          of info item menu screen.  Thanks to Erik Hanson and Mauro
          Giachero for assistance with this issue.

        * Improve the wording and button labeling of several dialogs;
          thanks to Erik Hanson for a patch to implement several of
          these improvements and thanks to The-Croupier for suggestions
          on another.

        * Clean up the customization menu.

        * Fix issue with typhoon_2001 not building correctly; thanks to
          cotterochan for the bug report.

        * Fix django download issue due to their weird tarball naming
          scheme; thanks to David Somero for the bug report.

        * Fix mplayer update issue; thanks to all the folks that
          reported this one.  Clearly, mlayer is a popular app.  :-)

        * Fix acroread update issue; thanks to Erik Hanson for the bug
          report.

        * Fix build queue failure issue found in 0.20.0rc1 due to not
          recovering from control-c cleanly; thanks to Mauro Giachero
          for the bug report.

        * Fix issue found in 0.20.0rc1 where packages could be added to
          queue more than once which caused some funky behavior; thanks
          to Mauro Giachero for the bug report.

        * Fix issue found in 0.20.0rc1 where customized SlackBuilds were
          not being used in the build process; thanks to Mauro Giachero
          for the bug report.

        * Fix issue found in 0.20.0rc1 where the queue processing would
          continue even after removing all packages from the queue;
          thanks to Mauro Giachero for the bug report.

    Changes to sbopkg.conf:

        As a result of some of these new features, users are advised of
        three changes to the sbopkg.conf file.  Users can either
        manually update their existing sbopkg.conf file or use the
        sbopkg.conf.new file that is installed when you upgrade sbopkg.

        * OUTPUT is now required.  This was commented out in prior
          versions of sbopkg.conf.  The default setting of OUTPUT is:

          export OUTPUT=${OUTPUT:-/tmp}

          this is the same default setting in SBo SlackBuild scripts
          themselves.

        * TERMBUILD is deprecated.  All building and installing switches
          now out of dialog and occurs in a terminal in all cases.
          Having the build take place inside the dialog interface caused
          some issues and made it difficult to implement some of the new
          features.  So, it went.  As a result, you can delete TERMBUILD
          from your sbopkg.conf file.

        * As mentioned above, DEBUG is a new required variable in the
          sbopkg.conf file.  The default setting is DEBUG=0.

sbopkg 0.15.0 (2008-12-11 02:45 UTC)

    Congrats to Patrick and the team on the new release of Slackware
    12.2.

    * Slackware 12.2 is now the default Slackware version selected when
      using sbopkg.

    * Fix an issue where sometimes a built package was incorrectly
      listed in the software info item menu, i.e. mplayer-codecs-all
      instead of mplayer.  Thanks to necropresto for the bug report.

    * Add --no-owner to default rsync flags to avoid having the local
      SBo repo tagged with owner 1016 permissions.  Thanks to Pierre
      Cazenave for the bug report and Erik Hanson for the suggested
      solution.

sbopkg 0.14.1 (2008-12-04 09:35 UTC)

    * Fix issue where certain package names were showing up incorrectly
      in the 'install' option - i.e. mplayer instead of
      mplayer-codecs-all.  Thanks to necropresto for the bug report.

    * A few little cleanups and cruft-removal.

sbopkg 0.14.0 (2008-11-16 17:15 UTC)

    * Various fixes related to the SlackBuilds.org update changing
      certain 'xx' to '++', such as TiMidity++, libsigc++, and libxml++.

    * The info item menus now display the repo's software version in the
      menu title, and also display whether the package has been
      installed at the top of the screen.  This is a really nice
      improvement.  Thanks to Erik Hanson for the patch.

    * Improve the Control-C trapping.

    * Fix the issue where simply pressing 'Enter' in the search box
      would result in all packages in the repo being listed as search
      results.  Now, it just returns to the main menu.

    * Fix xerces-c issue in the update list.  Thanks to João Felipe
      Santos for the bug report.

    * Lots of other little cleanups and cruft-removal.

    * Also, the sbopkg package itself now has a tag at the end, in
      keeping with typical Slackware package convention.

      In addition, a new home page (http://www.sbopkg.org) has been set
      up. Many thanks to the guys at cardinal.lizella.net, and their
      colocation provider, Cyberlink International
      (http://cyberlinkint.com) for the hosting.

sbopkg 0.13.1 (2008-10-28 14:06 UTC)

    * A fix for OpenOffice.org not being picked up correctly on the
      updatelist feature.  Thanks to Erik Hanson for the bug report.

    * A fix for a couple issues that appeared with the changes to the
      rsync and wget flags in version 0.13.0.  Thanks to Ken Roberts and
      Jorge Gaton for the bug reports.  To remedy this problem, I have
      removed TIMEOUT from sbopkg.conf and instead added two optional
      variables, RSYNCFLAGS and WGETFLAGS.  These options have been
      populated with some of the flags that were previously in the
      sbopkg script itself.  This means that folks can manually tweak
      the flags used by rsync and wget, although in most cases the
      defaults should be left alone.  This also means that for those who
      are upgrading sbopkg from a previous version will again need to
      manually update their sbopkg.conf from the sbopkg.conf.new that is
      installed and merge the changes.  Sorry about these changes to the
      configuration file, but hopefully they are for the better since
      these changes fix the problems mentioned previously and also give
      the users a bit more control over the flags used, if desired.

sbopkg 0.13.0 (2008-10-25 12:38 UTC)

    * New code has been added to allow the user to cleanly abort the
      source download by pressing Control-C; thanks to Zordak for the
      suggestion.

    * Add in several improvements to the rsync and wget stages, whereby
      better error messages are detected and displayed, -z is removed
      from rsync, and other general cleanups; thanks to macavity for the
      suggestions and patches.

    * Add in -O option to wget to allow for cases where downloaded
      source name is different than expected (such as virtualbox-ose);
      thanks to acidchild for the bug report.

    * Add in new sbopkg.conf variable TIMEOUT to allow the user to
      manually set the timeout value for rsync and wget; thanks to
      macavity for the suggestion.  NOTE:  this will require users
      upgrading from previous versions to either merge the new
      sbopkg.conf into their existing file, or manually add a TIMEOUT=10
      (default is 10 seconds) to their existing sbopkg.conf file.

    * Add in several updatelist fixes; thanks to Erik Hanson for the bug
      reports.

    * Add in fix where searching for category names would create
      problems; thanks to nille for the bug report.

    * Add in some new code in an initial attempt to fix the 'decimal'
      problem in bash, in which comparing package versions (like 3.9
      versus 3.11) would result in incorrect updatelist results.  This
      code should fix some updatelist errors reported by Erik Hanson,
      samac, and João Felipe Santos.  This new code needs testing, so
      please check the updatelist and then consider running it with the
      debug feature enabled and check the results the again.  See the
      UPDATELIST-DEBUGGING document for details on how to enable
      debugging.

    * Fix size of several dialog boxes for a better UI; thanks to Erik
      Hanson for the bug report.

    * Several error-checking and graceful exit cleanups and fixes.

sbopkg 0.12.0 (2008-10-07 14:05 UTC)

    * New code that better catches MD5SUM failures and offers the
      opportunity to delete the corrupted source.

    * New menu entry that allows a user to manually delete the saved
      sources for any particular software in the SBo repository.  Thanks
      to Drew Ames for the bug reports and suggestions that led to both
      of these two fixes and additions.

    * Add in ability to edit the *.info file in a similar manner to
      editing the SlackBuild.  With this addition, a user can now
      manually update the .info and SlackBuild from within sbopkg and
      build and install an updated package before it hits the repo.  If
      you use vi/vim as your EDITOR and want an easy way to insert the
      MD5SUM of a new source tarball, try ":r! md5sum
      /path/to/new/source".  Then clean up the inserted information into
      a proper .info file layout.  Thanks to nille for prodding me to
      get this done.

    * Move the editing functions into a submenu to better organize the
      'info item' menu for each software selection.  Thanks to nille for
      the suggestion.

    * Several error-checking and graceful exit cleanups and fixes.

sbopkg 0.11.2 (2008-09-16 22:41 UTC)

    * The pid file is now properly removed when using sbopkg from the
      cli; many thanks to LukenShiro for the bug report and help with
      testing.

    * Checks for the various sbopkg-related directories and files are
      improved.

    * A couple of updatelist fixes; thanks to LukenShiro for the bug
      reports.

sbopkg 0.11.1 (2008-09-12 17:32 UTC)

    This is a minor bug fix for version 0.11.0.

sbopkg 0.11.0 (2008-09-12 14:51 UTC)

    * After many, _many_ requests, sbopkg now adds preliminary support
      to install a package by calling upgradepkg --reinstall
      --install-new.  Currently, this new feature is only available in
      the dialog interface (the cli version will include this feature
      shortly).  If sbopkg finds a package for the selected application
      in the OUTPUT directory, then a new menu item will automagically
      appear allowing the user to install the package.  Thanks very much
      to Erik Hanson for the initial code to get this working.  Please
      do test this functionality and let me know if there are any
      issues.

    * Much improved menu navigation -- the 'Return to Main Menu' feature
      that appeared in the last release is now moved down as a button
      next to "Ok" and "Back."  Additionally, several of "Cancel"
      buttons are renamed "Back." I think these changes greatly improve
      things from a user interface perspective.  Thanks to Erik Hanson
      for the suggestions.

    * There is a new option in sbopkg.conf "TERMBUILD" that allows a
      user to optionally have the package building process step outside
      of dialog and process in a regular terminal.  Thanks to Erik
      Hanson for the suggestion and patch to make this work.

    * Create a pid file when sbopkg is first run and check for its
      existence to prevent multiple instances of sbopkg from running.
      Thanks to David Somero for the suggestion.

    * Add in several bugfixes for the update list.  Thanks to Erik
      Hanson and The-spiki for the bug reports.

sbopkg 0.10.0 (2008-08-27 04:53 UTC)

    * Committed a patch from that fixes ubuntulooks update bug, removes
      ARCH from the update comparison code to prevent false positive
      when different arches are used, and fixes libsigc++ and TiMidity++
      update bugs; thanks to Bert Babington for the patch.

    * Modified the sbopkg.conf file to allow easier/more correct
      exporting of variables; thanks to Ken Roberts for the patch and
      helpful dialog on the issue.  Please note that the default sbopkg
      TMP has moved from /tmp to /tmp/SBo, so be sure to move your
      permanent build log and package debugging list, if any, to the new
      location.

    * Renamed sbopkg.conf.sample to sbopkg.conf.new and incorporate a
      doinst.sh script per general Slackware convention; thanks to Ken
      Roberts for the suggestion, patch, and doinst.sh script.  This
      sbopkg.conf.new is the new 'sample' configuration file.  As such,
      please back up your old sbopkg.conf and then consider merging any
      changes you made to your old sbopkg.conf and then renaming the
      sbopkg.conf.new to sbopkg.conf.

    * Add a "Return to Main Menu' function in the package information
      menu; thanks to Murat D. Kadirov for the suggestion.

    * Include fixes for several other packages in the update code.

    * Fixed some typos; thanks to samac for the report.

    * Add a feature to view the sbopkg README from the main menu.

    * Lots and lots of little fixes, tweaks, and cleanups throughout the
      script.  The error checking and other similar low-level plumbing
      issues are generally improved.

    * Several changes/edits to the man pages and other documentation.

sbopkg 0.0.9 (2008-08-14 04:06 UTC)

    * Several bug fixes in the update list to prevent false positives.
      Thanks to ktabic and Antoine for the bug reports.

    * Fixed some things so that a user can now correctly set a different
      TMP, SRCDIR, OUTPUT etc. in sbopkg.conf, which means that someone
      can completely segregate sbopkg and it's related SBo-building and
      package dumping directories, for example, /sbo/tmp, /sbo/cache,
      /sbo/packages etc.  See the sbopkg.conf(5) man page for details.
      Thanks to Ken Roberts for the bug report.

    * New features include the ability to clear the cache directory from
      within the dialog interface and to display all installed SBo
      packages in the dialog and cli.

    * The search results page has been improved and the user can now
      jump directly to a package's information menu from the search
      results page.  Thanks to Erik Hanson for the diffs, suggestions,
      whitespace cleanups, and bug fixes.

    * Menu navigation has been greatly improved so that sbopkg remembers
      where you are when navigating up and down through the menus.
      Again, big thanks to Erik Hanson for this improvement.

sbopkg 0.0.8 (2008-08-04 02:02 UTC)

    * The major addition to this version is the ability to search for
      and display potential updates to SBo packages installed on the
      user's system.  There are also verious other bug-fixes and code
      cleanups.  Big thanks to Erik Hanson for his suggestions and help
      with the new update code.

sbopkg 0.0.7 (2008-05-17 03:20 UTC)

    * Sbopkg now properly creates the /home/sbo/12.1 directory if it
      doesn't exist (or equivalent as set in sbopkg.conf).  Note the
      user still has to manually create the 'root' directory where the
      SBo mirror will be held -- i.e. /home/sbo in this example.

    * Category list menu has been tweaked to include the two new SBo
      categories in the full view.

    * Some old commented out cruft has been removed.

sbopkg 0.0.6.1 (2008-05-03 01:35 UTC)

    Congratulations to Patrick and the Slackware team on the release of
    Slackware 12.1.

    * The only change is to set the default SBo repository to 12.1 and
      update the man pages etc. to reference Slackware 12.1.  Otherwise,
      there are no substantive changes over 0.0.6.

sbopkg 0.0.6 (2008-04-13 15:24 UTC)

    * Ability to rsync with and browse SBo repos for different Slackware
      versions (currently 11.0 and 12.0, and will be updated when 12.1
      is out).

    * Improved search functionality for cli.  The -s switch is the same
      as before, and will display the README, *.info etc. for a
      particular package name.  New, however, is -q, which will search
      for packages by string and return a list of possible matches.
      This is now the search used in the dialog interface as well.

    * Various other cleanups and bugfixes.

      Also, the sbopkg Google Groups list has been created:

      http://groups.google.com/group/sbopkg-discuss

sbopkg 0.0.5 (2008-04-02 19:29 UTC)

    * Users can now copy and edit the SlackBuild within the dialog
      interface, keeping both the original and edited SlackBuild.

    * Build packages using original or edited SlackBuild.

    * Fixes to the permanent build log so it actually works from dialog
      or cli. ;-)

    * Ability to view/delete the permanent build log within dialog
      interface.

    * Basic search functionality built in to the dialog interface (shows
      what category a piece of software is in);

    * Better viewing of the README, .info, slack-desc, and SlackBuild
      from cli.

    * Various other cleanups.

sbopkg 0.0.4 (2008-03-29 17:26 UTC)

sbopkg 0.0.3 (2008-03-28 05:18 UTC)

    * More than one application can be searched at a time in the cli.

    * Build process window remains in state correctly, as does the rsync
      window.

    * Source tarballs are saved in a separate SRCDIR directory and
      symlinked to the build directory.

    * Can browse this SRCDIR cache directory within the dialog
      interface.

    * Thanks to slackmagik for several of these excellent suggestions
      and contributions.

sbopkg 0.0.2 (2008-03-26 16:00 UTC)

sbopkg 0.0.1 (2008-03-24 14:22 UTC)
