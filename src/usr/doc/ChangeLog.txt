Sbopkg 0.33.1 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * The ARCH assignment was modified to accord with the latest SBo SlackBuild
    template.
  * Tweaked widgets in select_repository() (no or less scrolling) and
    load_user_queue() (better button) and modified check_gpg() to not disrupt
    the dialog interface with gpg output
  * Revised the KNOWN_ISSUES file and other documentation
+--------------------------+
Mon May 24 20:53:43 UTC 2010
Sbopkg 0.33.0 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Addressed an apparent bash 4.1 bug that causes the 'obsolete sources'
    function to break.
  * Addressed issue 44 where hitting ^C during the download of part of a queue
    and restarting the queue could result in a download failure. Thanks to
    slava18 for the report.
  * Changed the menu order of the "Build options" dialog to default to using
    "Saved" options rather than "None".
  * Fixed issue 45 where packages with '+' in the name were not properly
    detected in some cases. Thanks to skalkoto for the report.
  * Added a help item to the main menu of the dialog interface with pointers
    to documentation and other resources.
  * Added an option to print the version of sbopkg. We try not to change the
    meaning of flags but note that this does change what was the '-v' flag to
    '-V' and now uses '-v' for its customary 'version' purpose. Note that the
    new -V flag now accepts a '?' argument (sbopkg -V ?) which will display
    the list of valid repositories.
  * Tweak the logic re determining ARCH and modify some ARCH-related
    evals and conditionals in check_for_updates and info_item.
  * Fixed a bug which could result in some sources being missed when checking
    for obsolete sources.
  * Added a command line option '-P' to access the 'remove uninstalled
    packages' function which had previously only been accessible from the
    dialog interface.
  * Miscellaneous tweaks in preparation for release and to bring in line with
    Slackware 13.1.
+--------------------------+
Fri Mar  5 21:29:21 UTC 2010
Sbopkg 0.32.0 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Add several renames to 50-default renames file.
  * Add support for UNSUPPORTED/UNTESTED packages in the SBo repo; thanks to
    artourter for the bug report.
  * Honor the TAG exported by the user; thanks to Matteo Bernardini for the
    feature request.
  * Fix issue where delete sources in package info item menu did not work in
    some cases; thanks to artourter for the report, thanks to slakmagik for
    the hard work in fixing this and thanks to Mauro for the review and
    suggestions.
  * Add the ability to skip the prompts for sbopkg's directory creations via
    the new config file option MKDIR_PROMPT. This is useful, for example, if
    you have some SBo/sbopkg directories on a temporary filesystem and don't
    want to be bothered with repeated directory creation prompts. Thanks to
    agikhan for the report.
  * Address an issue where sbopkg could sometimes pick an older package to
    present for installation rather than the most recent one; thanks to
    artourter for the report.
  * Prevent sbopkg from spitting error messages when trying to determine the
    version of some packages (e.g. google-chrome, whose version is discovered
    looking into the source package which can be missing). Thanks to alkos333
    for the bug report.
  * Add ability to temporarily change $ARCH in the 'options' submenu.
+--------------------------+
Sun Nov  1 02:54:29 UTC 2009
Sbopkg 0.31.0 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Fix typo in 50-default renames file.
  * Fix the "Uncheck installed" feature. The code apparently worked fine even
    without the fix. Spotted by slakmagik.
  * Add $ARCH information in dialog backtitles.
  * Add ":force" to sbopkg.conf WGETFLAGS --progress=bar to correctly
    display the wget progress bar; thanks to happyslacker for nudging me on
    this issue again.
  * Fix an issue with the build options dialog menu where selecting 'None'
    would not work; thanks to happyslacker for the bug report.
  * Add the ability to uninstall SBo packages from the dialog interface that
    lists installed packages. Thanks to pokipoki08 for the suggestion.
  * Fix an incompatibility regarding the way bash 3.1, 3.2, and 4.0 handle the
    RHS of [[ commands using the =~ operator which broke the repo file
    validation, among other things. Thanks to SiegeX, Zmyrgel, and BCarey for
    the reports and suggestions.
  * Add the ability to run multiple sbopkg instances simultaneously. This has
    been suggested many times in the past. Users should read the sbopkg.conf
    man page before using this option (which is disabled by default).
  * Be more strict validating YES/NO configuration variables.
  * Add a KNOWN_ISSUES file - if you encounter a bug, check this file before
    reporting it to see if it's known and if there's a workaround.
  * Modify sspm to be root-only and change the default checkout location. In
    case it isn't obvious, this means the checkout will be root-owned if it
    isn't already.
  * Fix cosmetic bug where ARCH and BUILD were not displaying correctly in
    list of updates on x86_64.
  * Add a dialog and cli option to show all READMEs for the queued packages.
    This can come handy to do "final checks" on the active queue before
    starting the build process.
  * Reworked the options selection menu to avoid seeing only a truncated set
    of the actual options; thanks to Erik Hanson for the bug report.
  * Work around build issues caused by custom LC_COLLATE values.
  * Add tint=tint2 to /etc/sbopkg/renames.d/50-default file.
  * Prevent an infinite download loop by modifying get_source() and
    check_source(); make sure that we do try to guess about the file name in a
    DOWNLOAD/filename mismatch but only when we absolutely have to, by
    modifying get_source_names(). Thanks to godling for noticing the problem.
  * The 'check for updates' function now always lists apparent downgrades,
    since it sometimes can mistakenly classify an upgrade as a downgrade
    (e.g. version 1.0.1 looks older than 1.0-rc2 to sbopkg). The apparent
    downgrades are added to the queue but are disabled by default.
+--------------------------+
Fri Aug 28 17:34:35 UTC 2009
Sbopkg 0.30.1 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Fix the updates code for the 13.0 repo; thanks to everybody who
    contacted us about this issue.
  * Fix the $SBOPKGTMP sanity check. Thanks to Ken Roberts for raising the
    issue.
  * Update the renames file.
+--------------------------+
Mon Aug 24 17:28:48 UTC 2009
Sbopkg 0.30.0 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Move sbopkg to /usr/sbin; update sbopkg.SlackBuild and sspm to reflect
    /usr/sbin.
  * Change default directory paths in sbopkg.conf.new; add new variable
    SBOPKGTMP, which will be used to store sbopkg-related temp files; also
    add new variable LOGDIR which will contain any sbopkg-related log files.
  * Remove code related to user-mode support; sbopkg must now be run as
    root in all cases; add single check at start of script to make sure we
    are root.
  * Apply a major code cleanup that touches just about every part of sbopkg.
    This cleanup makes the code more readable, manageable, and less bug-prone.
    Several bugs were fixed as part of this cleanup, and the cleanup will ease
    further development and debugging efforts.
  * Remove some useless code from check_for_latest and also fix the
    download folder for sbopkg updates.  Thanks to David Somero for the bug
    report.
  * Re-implement the code that checks for renamed software; fix upgrading
    of renamed packages; thanks to Phillip Warner for raising the issues
    with the older code; thanks to Mauro Giachero for working on these fixes.
  * Fix a tr invocation issue where in certain instances, sbopkg would not run
    from certain directories; thanks to Marie-Claude Collilieux for the bug
    report.
  * Alter sed expression in download code to work around calcurse filename
    idiosyncrasy; thanks to Glenn Becker for the bug report.
  * Move French man pages into correct /usr/man/fr* location and remove them
    from the /docs directory; update French man pages; thanks to
    Marie-Claude Collilieux.
  * Remove a stale 'find' call, which slightly improves the update feature.
  * Add acroread->adobe-reader, GNOME-Colors->gnome-colors, wbxml2->libwbxml
    and museek-plus->museek+ renames.
  * Display a message when no packages are installed instead of doing nothing.
  * Properly quote the current working directory variable in the event there
    are spaces in the directory name.
  * Fix a bug where 'sbopkg -c -v local' would display a dialog even though
    running in cli mode.
  * Fix issue where the 'games' directory was non-browsable due to a
    slack-desc file containing double-quotes in the first line; thanks to
    Glenn Becker for the original bug report.
  * Implement configurable repository support by introducing a new
    /etc/sbopkg/repos.d directory where separate repositories files can be
    maintained and also by adding support for git-based repositories.  The
    Slamd64Builds repository is now listed, to the joy of all the Slamd64
    users out there.  Add a new document README-repos.d that explains how
    these repository files work.
  * 'Nice' the build process so as to improve sbopkg's resource utilization.
  * Fix a few issues regarding user sbopkg.conf files.
  * Move sbopkg-renames to new /etc/sbopkg/renames.d/50-default to manage
    multiple renames files.  Thanks to Robby Workman for the suggestion.  Add
    new document README-renames.d that explains how this works.
  * Add support for new *.txz, *.tlz, and *.tbz Slackware package extensions.
  * Rewrite several portions of the process_queue function in order to
    properly handle certain items by the caller; clean up and improve the
    logging displayed during the build process.
  * Require build queuefiles have a '.sqf' file extension.
  * Add a sanity check for files in sbopkg's temp directory.
  * Cleanup several of the functions related to editing the .info and
    SlackBuild files to remove code duplication; also cleanup and fix issues
    associated with the two primary search functions, and improve file cleanup
    for these search-related functions.
  * Fix issue where MD5SUM checking would fail when certain upstream packages
    do not change source file name on version updates by adding in an extra
    check for existing sources.  Additionally, add an option to retry a source
    download in the event of an MD5SUM failure to avoid having to restart a
    build.  Thanks to David Spencer for raising these issues and thanks to
    Mauro Giachero for the fixes and improvements.
  * Create a ChangeLog.txt for git repos on the fly.
  * Remove usage of ARCH in preparation for Slackware64 support.
  * Remove obsolete load_backup_queue.
  * Improve and fix some issues with the search functions and leaking
    variables.
  * Change queuefile format.  No longer will the queuefile format be 'APP
    VERSION ON/OFF' but instead will simply be one 'APP' per line.  If a user
    wants an APP to be deselected in the dialog menus, simply put a '-' in
    front of it, e.g. '-APP'.  This should make creating, using, and sharing
    queuefiles much easier and more intuitive.
  * Add ability to load more than one queuefile at a time when building
    from command line interface.
  * The info_item dialog now shows non-SBo installed packages and gained a
    more robust approach to finding both the installed package names and
    the available packages in $OUTPUT.
  * Add ability to dump all installed packages into a build queue.  This is an
    alphabetical list, so shuffling/reordering of the queue will be necessary
    in order to list the dependencies correctly, but at least this will give
    users a head start on setting up a large build queue.
  * The process of searching for obsolete source archives can now be
    interrupted with ESC.
  * Add several new functions related to checking GPG-signed tarballs, such as
    those that SlackBuilds.org provides.  Sbopkg will now automatically check
    these tarballs when building or installing a package.  Additionally, there
    are two new menu items in info_item that allow the user to check the GPG
    signature or re-extract the GPG-signed tarball.
  * Add ability to have recursive queuefiles, so one queuefile named
    "foo.sqf" may have an entry "@bar" in which case as the foo.sqf
    queuefile is parsed, it will recursively go down into the 'bar.sqf'
    queuefile as well.  The '@' symbol is used in front of an entry in a
    queuefile to denote another queuefile.
  * Remove the old "$APP $VERSION$BUILD $ONOFF" format for the temporary queue
    and instead make all queue formats "$APP" only.  This simplifies some code
    and results in a small speed increase.
  * Exit edit_build_queue menu with 'ESC'; thanks to Nille for the bug report.
  * Modify do_install() to correctly invoke upgradepkg to avoid a fairly rare
    but serious case of removing the wrong package; thanks to NaCl for the
    bug report.
  * Add ability to pass build options in a queuefile when separated by a pipe
    character, i.e. app | FOO=yes BAR=no means app will be built with FOO and
    BAR build options set as indicated.
  * Fix rare issue where incorrect file was upgraded; thanks to neonflux for
    the bug report.
  * Fix issue where custom build options may not be correctly exported.
  * Add a 'diff' entry to the script customization menu.
  * Add in 'uname -m' test for x86_64 and if so, set ARCH to x86_64.
  * Set default SBo repo to 13.0; add 13.0 repo to
    /etc/sbopkg/repos.d/40-sbo.repo.
  * Add support for multiple architectures and multiple source files. This
    makes sbopkg able to handle the new features that SlackBuilds.org admins
    are preparing for the Slackware 13.0 release.
  * Add option to retry a failed build. Thanks to Zordrak for suggesting this
    feature.
  * Add CLEANUP configuration variable, which when set to YES tells sbopkg to
    delete the extracted sources, and all the associated "residuals" of the
    build, as soon as the build is finished. Thanks to Marco Bonetti and
    Gregory Tourte for the suggestion and the nice discussion.
  * Add a function to delete obsolete (not installed) packages from $OUTPUT.
    Thanks to alkos333 for the idea.
  * Reorganize the queue editing functions a bit for a better user interface;
    'view queue' now only shows the queue; new 'sort' and 'remove' queue menu
    items now handle the editing functions; thanks to Pierre Cazenave for the
    suggestion.
  * Add dialog notification of whether a queued package is installed.
  * Add a dialog option to automatically uncheck installed packages from the
    active queue, together with a command line option -k that automatically
    skips such packages when building with -b or -i.
  * Add ability to 'invert' all selected/deselected in the clear cache and
    obsolete sources and packages dialogs; thanks to dive for the suggestion.
+--------------------------+
Thu Feb 26 14:48:54 UTC 2009
Sbopkg 0.27.0 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Commit a patch that adds a new sbopkg.conf configuration variable,
    QUEUEDIR, where users can define where saved queues are stored; also, when
    the user wants to load a saved queue, show a list of available saved
    queues; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Add ability to search for keywords in the README files using regular
    expressions; this new 'string search' can also be narrowed to only search
    installed packages; thanks to slakmagik for the original patch and
    implementation and thanks to both slakmagik and Mauro Giachero for
    cleaning it up and addressing minor issues before the commit.
  * Commit a cleanup/misc patch from slakmagik that removes some useless code
    and fixes some style issues; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Allow user to interrupt/abort the update progressbar by pressing ESC;
    thanks to Mauro Giachero for the feature.
  * Assorted menu navigation fixes, and document -p switch in sbopkg(8) man
    page; thanks to Mauro Giachero for these improvements.
  * Add ability to view a diff of an edited .info or SlackBuild file before
    choosing which one to use; this feature adds two configuration variables
    to the sbopkg.conf file: DIFF and DIFFOPTS; thanks to Phillip Warner for
    the suggestion and thanks to Mauro Giachero for helping debug/improve my
    original implemenation.
  * Add ability to view more files in each application's folder, i.e.
    doinst.sh, or *.desktop files; thanks to Phillip Warner for the suggestion
    and thanks to slakmagik for the patch implementing this feature.
  * Rework the check for root:root permissions when installing packages; now,
    if the package does not have root:root permissions, sbopkg will display
    the output of ls -l <packagename> and ask if the user wishes to install or
    abort, rather than only aborting.
  * Allow the usage of the -d, -f and -v command-line options in dialog mode,
    and output an error message when the command line contains unrecognized
    tokens.
  * Move the -q option to -g (general search) in order to make way for -q,
    'quiet mode' where the output of some of the command line options (i.e.
    the command line progressbar) can be minimized.  More quieting will likely
    occur in future releases.  Thanks to alkos333 for the feature request.
  * Implement a workaround so that the dialog interface now works better with
    GNU Screen and rxvt-based terminals. Thanks to Phillip Warner for raising
    the issue and thanks to Mauro Giachero for working on the implementation.
  * Include a French translation of the two sbopkg man pages.  For now, these
    man pages will be included in the /doc directory until I have time to
    figure out whether they can be automatically installed in place of the
    English ones depending on a locale setting.  In any event, I would like to
    extend my thanks to Marie-Claude Collilieux for providing this first
    translation for sbopkg.  I am sure folks will appreciate the work she put
    into it.  If anyone else wants to follow her lead and provide some other
    translations, I would be happy to include them.  Thanks Marie-Claude!
  * Add in several patches from slakmagik that lets the user choose from saved
    queues, modifies how the saved queues and backup queues work, and modifies
    several other queue-related functions and menus.  Many thanks to slakmagik
    for his continually excellent contributions.
  * Implement an 'autoqueue' by allowing the user to specify queue names to
    '-b' and '-i' and by adding a -e option whereby the user can specify what
    to do on errors (stop, ask, or continue).  Thanks to Alan Hicks for
    suggesting this feature and thanks to Mauro Giachero for the
    implementation.
+--------------------------+
Fri Jan 30 23:03:49 UTC 2009
Sbopkg 0.26.2 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Fix regression where packages could not be installed in certain
    instances.  Thanks to artourter for the bug report.
+--------------------------+
Fri Jan 30 04:21:44 UTC 2009
Sbopkg 0.26.1 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Implement some security fixes, namely, customize the output of some of the
    menus so only things that can be done as root (i.e. build, install,
    process the queue) are seen by the root user; also add a check to make
    sure only root can install packages and that packages are correctly set
    with root:root permissions.  Thanks to Phillip Warner for the report and
    suggestions.
  * Modify SLACKVER in sbopkg.conf so it can be passed at runtime to sbopkg.
    Thanks to TSquaredF for the suggestion.
  * Quiet down the number of messages displayed when updated items are added
    to the queue; thanks to Phillip Warner for the suggestion.
  * Fix issue where sometimes duplicate items would appear in the search
    results dialog; thanks to Phillip Warner for the suggestion.
+--------------------------+
Thu Jan 29 14:41:00 UTC 2009
Sbopkg 0.26.0 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Add in new update code by Mauro Giachero.  This /greatly/ improves how the
    updates are handled and virtually eliminates the need for specific
    application quirks.  Please note there is a new file
    /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg-renames that handles a few name changes.  If you
    upgrade sbopkg with the new package, then this file will be automatically
    installed.  If not, you'll need to grab this file from the source tarball
    and move it there manually.  Many thanks to Mauro for the hard work in
    finally getting the update code done right.  :-)
  * Change how selecting/unselecting items in the build queue are handled.
    Now, when items are unselected, they remain in the queue but are turned
    "OFF" and when the queue is processed, only those packages turned "ON"
    will be built or installed.
  * Improve how packages are added to the queue.  The user is now prompted if
    they want to replace items already in the queue or skip them.  This may be
    helpful if a user has saved a queue with lots of dependencies that are
    then updated through the rsync process.  The updates can be added to the
    queue, replacing the old versions.
  * Add in a nice progress gauge when running the update list rather than the
    warning message.  Thanks to alkos333 for the idea and initial
    implementation, and thanks to Mauro Giachero for working on the CLI
    version.
  * Merge in a large whitespace/cleanup patch by slakmagik which greatly
    improves the readability of the code; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Replace the 'Clear Queue' menu item with 'Delete Queue Items' which
    provides the user the ability to delete individual items in the queue or
    clear the entire build queue.
  * Add in ability to have a /local directory in the local SBo repository tree
    on a user's system that is in parallel with other SBo directories (i.e.
    /home/sbo/local).  As long as this directory is maintained in an SBo style
    (including user-defined categories), then sbopkg will pick them up and the
    user can change their SLACKVER to 'local' and build/install packages from
    there.  This might be useful in testing pre-submissions to SBo or for
    maintaining other software not in SBo.  This was inspired by a similar
    idea contributed by slakmagik.  Please see the sbopkg.conf(5) man page for
    more information.
  * Commit a patch from slakmagik that adds a new sbopkg.conf variable LOGFILE
    where the user can decide the name and location of the permanent build
    log, if used; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Improve the configuration file handling so that sbopkg now runs even with
    a missing or deficient system-wide configuration file, as long as the
    user's ~/.sbopkg.conf file is present and fills the gaps.
  * Fix issue where downloaded sources with spaces in their file names would
    cause an MD5SUM failure; thanks to alkos333 for the bug report, and thanks
    to Mauro Giachero for improving my initial bug fix implementation.
  * Commit several other patches from slakmagik that improve the handling of
    the search box upon search failures; tweak the precheck log a bit; improve
    the checking of root privilegs, and improve the handling of the
    directory-creation checks; thanks to slakmagik for these patches.
  * Fix issue where a failed download would still go through an md5sum check;
    now it informs the user of the failed download and asks if the user wishes
    to continue with the build queue or abort.
  * Eliminate some redundant or annoying messages to the user, such as when
    the backup queue is saved.
  * Add 'sspm' utility script by slakmagik which makes mirroring the sbopkg
    SVN repository and making a package from the local SVN mirror very easy;
    this script is located in the /tools directory in the sbopkg SVN
    repository; thanks to slakmagik for the script.
  * Fix issue where ARCH would sometimes not get picked up in info_item menu
    (notably for OpenOffice.org); thanks to artourter for the bug report, and
    thanks to Mauro for the fix.
  * Lots of other internal 'under the hood' improvements to the repository
    browsing, directory check functionality, build queue, and just general
    overall code cleanup.
+--------------------------+
Sat Jan 17 02:15:03 UTC 2009
Sbopkg 0.25.0 released.  This is another version jump due to the
number of fixes, enhancements, and new features:

  * Fix issue where packages were sometimes incorrectly identified as
    already being in the build queue when they were not; thanks to
    SpacePlod for the bug report and thanks to Mauro Giachero for
    further bug reporting and providing a patch to fix it.
  * Add ability to pass build options/flavors/arguments to the
    SlackBuild when using the dialog interface.
  * Include ability to reverse or manually sort the items in the build
    queue; thanks to Mauro Giachero for the patches to implement these
    features.
  * Move all the queue functions into a separate 'Manage Queue'
    submenu off the main menu.
  * Allow user to save (and load) the build queue between sessions by
    specifing a file and location, so multiple saved queues can be
    maintained.
  * Automatically backup the current queue upon exiting and offer to
    reload upon first entering the queue submenu.
  * Provide a menu entry to clear the build queue.
  * Merge in several patches from Mauro Giachero to display the SVN
    version number; clean up use of cancel/back and ESC (ESC now takes
    you back a step in most dialogs); improve the cleanup process; and
    improve the new build flavors/options dialog.
  * Apply several patches from slakmagik for various little fixes,
    cleanups, and tweaks.
  * Create a new 'Utilities' submenu off the main menu and move some
    of the less-important items there in order to clean up the main
    menu.  It was getting a bit bulky.  :-)
  * Add ability to download a new sbopkg package when there is an
    update.
  * Include optional use of a ~/.sbopkg.conf, which will override
    settings in the system /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf file.
  * When changing the Slackware version in the dialog interface, offer
    the user the opportunity to save this change in the new
    ~/.sbopkg.conf file.
  * Improve build queue logging and error reporting; correctly remove
    symlink to the source tarball when build fails.
  * Bump default wget timeout from 10 to 15 seconds which prevents
    some downloads from failing.
  * Add update list fix for ksmoothdock; thanks to Wade Grant for the
    bug report.
  * Improve how the sources are downloaded and identified.
  * Remove the 'read sbopkg README' from the main menu.
  * Add a directory check for OUTPUT since that is now required.
  * Add preliminary check to make sure command line options -b and -i
    are not used together.
  * Fix issue where certain packages in queue that end with a ++ (like
    libsigc++) could not be added.
+--------------------------+
Thu Jan 1 20:53:19 UTC 2009
Sbopkg version 0.20.0 released.  This a version jump due to the
numerous fixes, enhancements, and new features.

New features:

  * There is a new -i command line switch that allows the user to
    build and install packages in a manner similar to the current -b
    switch for building only.  As with the -b switch, the user can
    build and install more than one package by listing them in quotes.
    And, by carefully listing dependencies in the right order, it
    might be possible to build and install dependencies and the final,
    target package in one go, like this:

    # sbopkg -i "imlib2 giblib feh"

    In this case, imlib2 must be built and installed before giblib,
    both of which need to be built and installed before feh.  Given
    the nature of building dependencies, this may not always work, but
    it still may be helpful and useful in many cases.
  * Coupled with the new -i switch, there is a new 'build queue' in
    the dialog interface.  The user can add packages to the queue and
    then, when ready, can process the queue in the order the packages
    are listed.  The user can choose to build only or build and
    install the packages in the queue.  Again, by listing dependencies
    in the right order, it may be possible to build dependencies and
    the final, target package in one go like the feh example above.
  * After checking for updates, the user is offered the opportunity to
    add those flagged updates to the build queue automatically.
  * When building packages individually outside of the build queue,
    the user is offered the opportunity to build or build and install
    the package.
  * There is a new -u command line switch, and a corresponding new
    dialog menu selection, that allows the user to check if there is
    an update to sbopkg itself.
  * A new DEBUG variable is introduced to the sbopkg.conf file that
    allow for easier debugging and update list bug reporting.  See the
    sbopkg.conf man page for more detail.

Bug Fixes:

  * Fix issues with the "Installed/Not Installed" text at the top of
    info item menu screen.  Thanks to Erik Hanson and Mauro Giachero
    for assistance with this issue.
  * Improve the wording and button labeling of several dialogs; thanks
    to Erik Hanson for a patch to implement several of these
    improvements and thanks to The-Croupier for suggestions on
    another.
  * Clean up the customization menu.
  * Fix issue with typhoon_2001 not building correctly; thanks to
    cotterochan for the bug report.
  * Fix django download issue due to their weird tarball naming
    scheme; thanks to David Somero for the bug report.
  * Fix mplayer update issue; thanks to all the folks that reported
    this one.  Clearly, mlayer is a popular app.  :-)
  * Fix acroread update issue; thanks to Erik Hanson for the bug
    report.
  * Fix build queue failure issue found in 0.20.0rc1 due to not
    recovering from control-c cleanly; thanks to Mauro Giachero for
    the bug report.
  * Fix issue found in 0.20.0rc1 where packages could be added to
    queue more than once which caused some funky behavior; thanks to
    Mauro Giachero for the bug report.
  * Fix issue found in 0.20.0rc1 where customized SlackBuilds were not
    being used in the build process; thanks to Mauro Giachero for the
    bug report.
  * Fix issue found in 0.20.0rc1 where the queue processing would
    continue even after removing all packages from the queue; thanks
    to Mauro Giachero for the bug report.

Changes to sbopkg.conf:

As a result of some of these new features, users are advised of three
changes to the sbopkg.conf file.  Users can either manually update
their existing sbopkg.conf file or use the sbopkg.conf.new file that
is installed when you upgrade sbopkg.

sbopkg.conf change 1: OUTPUT is now required.  This was commented out
in prior versions of sbopkg.conf.  The default setting of OUTPUT is:

export OUTPUT=${OUTPUT:-/tmp}

this is the same default setting in SBo SlackBuild scripts themselves.

sbopkg.conf change 2: TERMBUILD is deprecated.  All building and
installing switches now out of dialog and occurs in a terminal in all
cases.  Having the build take place inside the dialog interface caused
some issues and made it difficult to implement some of the new
features.  So, it went.  As a result, you can delete TERMBUILD from
your sbopkg.conf file.

sbopkg.conf change 3: As mentioned above, DEBUG is a new required
variable in the sbopkg.conf file.  The default setting is DEBUG=0.

Congrats to Patrick and the team on the new release of Slackware
12.2.

Sbopkg version 0.15.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Slackware 12.2 is now the default Slackware version selected when
    using sbopkg.
  * Fix an issue where sometimes a built package was incorrectly
    listed in the software info item menu, i.e. mplayer-codecs-all
    instead of mplayer.  Thanks to necropresto for the bug report.
  * Add --no-owner to default rsync flags to avoid having the local
    SBo repo tagged with owner 1016 permissions.  Thanks to Pierre
    Cazenave for the bug report and Erik Hanson for the suggested
    solution.
+--------------------------+
Thu Dec 4 09:35:09 UTC 2008
Sbopkg version 0.14.1 released.  This is a minor bug-fix release:

  * Fix issue where certain package names were showing up incorrectly
    in the 'install' option - i.e. mplayer instead of
    mplayer-codecs-all.  Thanks to necropresto for the bug report.
  * A few little cleanups and cruft-removal.
+--------------------------+
Sun Nov 16 17:15:49 UTC 2008
Sbopkg version 0.14.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Various fixes related to the SlackBuilds.org update changing
    certain 'xx' to '++', such as TiMidity++, libsigc++, and libxml++.
  * The info item menus now display the repo's software version in the
    menu title, and also display whether the package has been
    installed at the top of the screen.  This is a really nice
    improvement.  Thanks to Erik Hanson for the patch.
  * Improve the Control-C trapping.
  * Fix the issue where simply pressing 'Enter' in the search box
    would result in all packages in the repo being listed as search
    results.  Now, it just returns to the main menu.
  * Fix xerces-c issue in the update list.  Thanks to João Felipe
    Santos for the bug report.
  * Lots of other little cleanups and cruft-removal.
  * Also, the sbopkg package itself now has a tag at the end, in
    keeping with typical Slackware package convention.

In addition, a new home page (http://www.sbopkg.org) has been set up.
Many thanks to the guys at cardinal.lizella.net, and their colocation
provider, Cyberlink International (http://cyberlinkint.com) for the
hosting.

Sbopkg version 0.13.1 released.  This is primarily a bug-fix release:

  * A fix for OpenOffice.org not being picked up correctly on the
    updatelist feature.  Thanks to Erik Hanson for the bug report.
  * A fix for a couple issues that appeared with the changes to the
    rsync and wget flags in version 0.13.0.  Thanks to Ken Roberts and
    Jorge Gaton for the bug reports.  To remedy this problem, I have
    removed TIMEOUT from sbopkg.conf and instead added two optional
    variables, RSYNCFLAGS and WGETFLAGS.  These options have been
    populated with some of the flags that were previously in the
    sbopkg script itself.  This means that folks can manually tweak
    the flags used by rsync and wget, although in most cases the
    defaults should be left alone.  This also means that for those who
    are upgrading sbopkg from a previous version will again need to
    manually update their sbopkg.conf from the sbopkg.conf.new that is
    installed and merge the changes.  Sorry about these changes to the
    configuration file, but hopefully they are for the better since
    these changes fix the problems mentioned previously and also give
    the users a bit more control over the flags used, if desired.
+--------------------------+
Sat Oct 25 12:38:34 UTC 2008
Sbopkg version 0.13.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * New code has been added to allow the user to cleanly abort the
    source download by pressing Control-C; thanks to Zordak for the
    suggestion.
  * Add in several improvements to the rsync and wget stages, whereby
    better error messages are detected and displayed, -z is removed
    from rsync, and other general cleanups; thanks to macavity for the
    suggestions and patches.
  * Add in -O option to wget to allow for cases where downloaded
    source name is different than expected (such as virtualbox-ose);
    thanks to acidchild for the bug report.
  * Add in new sbopkg.conf variable TIMEOUT to allow the user to
    manually set the timeout value for rsync and wget; thanks to
    macavity for the suggestion.  NOTE:  this will require users
    upgrading from previous versions to either merge the new
    sbopkg.conf into their existing file, or manually add a TIMEOUT=10
    (default is 10 seconds) to their existing sbopkg.conf file.
  * Add in several updatelist fixes; thanks to Erik Hanson for the bug
    reports.
  * Add in fix where searching for category names would create
    problems; thanks to nille for the bug report.
  * Add in some new code in an initial attempt to fix the 'decimal'
    problem in bash, in which comparing package versions (like 3.9
    versus 3.11) would result in incorrect updatelist results.  This
    code should fix some updatelist errors reported by Erik Hanson,
    samac, and João Felipe Santos.  This new code needs testing, so
    please check the updatelist and then consider running it with the
    debug feature enabled and check the results the again.  See the
    UPDATELIST-DEBUGGING document for details on how to enable
    debugging.
  * Fix size of several dialog boxes for a better UI; thanks to Erik
    Hanson for the bug report.
  * Several error-checking and graceful exit cleanups and fixes.
+--------------------------+
Tue Oct 7 14:05:36 UTC 2008
Sbopkg version 0.12.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * New code that better catches MD5SUM failures and offers the
    opportunity to delete the corrupted source.
  * New menu entry that allows a user to manually delete the saved
    sources for any particular software in the SBo repository.  Thanks
    to Drew Ames for the bug reports and suggestions that led to both
    of these two fixes and additions.
  * Add in ability to edit the *.info file in a similar manner to
    editing the SlackBuild.  With this addition, a user can now
    manually update the .info and SlackBuild from within sbopkg and
    build and install an updated package before it hits the repo.  If
    you use vi/vim as your EDITOR and want an easy way to insert the
    MD5SUM of a new source tarball, try ":r! md5sum
    /path/to/new/source".  Then clean up the inserted information into
    a proper .info file layout.  Thanks to nille for prodding me to
    get this done.
  * Move the editing functions into a submenu to better organize the
    'info item' menu for each software selection.  Thanks to nille for
    the suggestion.
  * Several error-checking and graceful exit cleanups and fixes.
+--------------------------+
Tue Sep 16 22:41:34 UTC 2008
Sbopkg version 0.11.2 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * The pid file is now properly removed when using sbopkg from the
    cli; many thanks to LukenShiro for the bug report and help with
    testing.
  * Checks for the various sbopkg-related directories and files are
    improved.
  * A couple of updatelist fixes; thanks to LukenShiro for the bug
    reports.
+--------------------------+
Fri Sep 12 12:32:07 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.11.1 released.  This is a minor bug fix for version
0.11.0.
+--------------------------+
Fri Sep 12 09:51:39 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.11.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * After many, _many_ requests, sbopkg now adds preliminary support
    to install a package by calling upgradepkg --reinstall
    --install-new.  Currently, this new feature is only available in
    the dialog interface (the cli version will include this feature
    shortly).  If sbopkg finds a package for the selected application
    in the OUTPUT directory, then a new menu item will automagically
    appear allowing the user to install the package.  Thanks very much
    to Erik Hanson for the initial code to get this working.  Please
    do test this functionality and let me know if there are any
    issues.
  * Much improved menu navigation -- the 'Return to Main Menu' feature
    that appeared in the last release is now moved down as a button
    next to "Ok" and "Back."  Additionally, several of "Cancel"
    buttons are renamed "Back." I think these changes greatly improve
    things from a user interface perspective.  Thanks to Erik Hanson
    for the suggestions.
  * There is a new option in sbopkg.conf "TERMBUILD" that allows a
    user to optionally have the package building process step outside
    of dialog and process in a regular terminal.  Thanks to Erik
    Hanson for the suggestion and patch to make this work.
  * Create a pid file when sbopkg is first run and check for its
    existence to prevent multiple instances of sbopkg from running.
    Thanks to David Somero for the suggestion.
  * Add in several bugfixes for the update list.  Thanks to Erik
    Hanson and The-spiki for the bug reports.
+--------------------------+
Tue Aug 26 23:53:13 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.10.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Committed a patch from that fixes ubuntulooks update bug, removes
    ARCH from the update comparison code to prevent false positive
    when different arches are used, and fixes libsigc++ and TiMidity++
    update bugs; thanks to Bert Babington for the patch.
  * Modified the sbopkg.conf file to allow easier/more correct
    exporting of variables; thanks to Ken Roberts for the patch and
    helpful dialog on the issue.  Please note that the default sbopkg
    TMP has moved from /tmp to /tmp/SBo, so be sure to move your
    permanent build log and package debugging list, if any, to the new
    location.
  * Renamed sbopkg.conf.sample to sbopkg.conf.new and incorporate a
    doinst.sh script per general Slackware convention; thanks to Ken
    Roberts for the suggestion, patch, and doinst.sh script.  This
    sbopkg.conf.new is the new 'sample' configuration file.  As such,
    please back up your old sbopkg.conf and then consider merging any
    changes you made to your old sbopkg.conf and then renaming the
    sbopkg.conf.new to sbopkg.conf.
  * Add a "Return to Main Menu' function in the package information
    menu; thanks to Murat D. Kadirov for the suggestion.
  * Include fixes for several other packages in the update code.
  * Fixed some typos; thanks to samac for the report.
  * Add a feature to view the sbopkg README from the main menu.
  * Lots and lots of little fixes, tweaks, and cleanups throughout the
    script.  The error checking and other similar low-level plumbing
    issues are generally improved.
  * Several changes/edits to the man pages and other documentation.
+--------------------------+
Wed Aug 13 23:06:07 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.0.9 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Several bug fixes in the update list to prevent false positives.
    Thanks to ktabic and Antoine for the bug reports.
  * Fixed some things so that a user can now correctly set a different
    TMP, SRCDIR, OUTPUT etc. in sbopkg.conf, which means that
    someone can completely segregate sbopkg and it's related
    SBo-building and package dumping directories, for example,
    /sbo/tmp, /sbo/cache, /sbo/packages etc.  See the sbopkg.conf(5)
    man page for details.  Thanks to Ken Roberts for the bug report.
  * New features include the ability to clear the cache directory from
    within the dialog interface and to display all installed SBo
    packages in the dialog and cli.
  * The search results page has been improved and the user can now
    jump directly to a package's information menu from the search
    results page.  Thanks to Erik Hanson for the diffs, suggestions,
    whitespace cleanups, and bug fixes.
  * Menu navigation has been greatly improved so that sbopkg remembers
    where you are when navigating up and down through the menus.
    Again, big thanks to Erik Hanson for this improvement.
+--------------------------+
Sun Aug 3 21:02:27 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.0.8 released.  The major addition to this version is
the ability to search for and display potential updates to SBo
packages installed on the user's system.  There are also verious other
bug-fixes and code cleanups.  Big thanks to Erik Hanson for his
suggestions and help with the new update code.
+--------------------------+
Fri May 16 22:20:52 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.0.7 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Sbopkg now properly creates the /home/sbo/12.1 directory if it
    doesn't exist (or equivalent as set in sbopkg.conf).  Note the
    user still has to manually create the 'root' directory where the
    SBo mirror will be held -- i.e. /home/sbo in this example.
  * Category list menu has been tweaked to include the two new SBo
    categories in the full view.
  * Some old commented out cruft has been removed.
+--------------------------+
Fri May 2 20:35:09 EST 2008
Congratulations to Patrick and the Slackware team on the release of
Slackware 12.1.

Sbopkg version 0.0.6.1 released.  The only change is to set the
default SBo repository to 12.1 and update the man pages etc. to
reference Slackware 12.1.  Otherwise, there are no substantive changes
over 0.0.6.
+--------------------------+
Sun Apr 13 10:24:27 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.0.6 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Ability to rsync with and browse SBo repos for different Slackware
    versions (currently 11.0 and 12.0, and will be updated when 12.1
    is out).
  * Improved search functionality for cli.  The -s switch is the same
    as before, and will display the README, *.info etc. for a
    particular package name.  New, however, is -q, which will search
    for packages by string and return a list of possible matches.
    This is now the search used in the dialog interface as well.
  * Various other cleanups and bugfixes.

Also, the sbopkg Google Groups list has been created:

http://groups.google.com/group/sbopkg-discuss
+--------------------------+
Wed Apr 2 14:29:36 EST 2008

fixes and enhancements:

  * Users can now copy and edit the SlackBuild within the dialog
    interface, keeping both the original and edited SlackBuild.
  * Build packages using original or edited SlackBuild.
  * Fixes to the permanent build log so it actually works from dialog
    or cli. ;-)
  * Ability to view/delete the permanent build log within dialog
    interface.
  * Basic search functionality built in to the dialog interface (shows
    what category a piece of software is in);
  * Better viewing of the README, .info, slack-desc, and SlackBuild
    from cli.
  * Various other cleanups.

    symlinked to the build directory.
  * Can browse this SRCDIR cache directory within the dialog
    interface.
  * Thanks to slackmagik for several of these excellent suggestions
    and contributions.
