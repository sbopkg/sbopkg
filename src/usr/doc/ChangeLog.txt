Sbopkg 0.25.0 released.  This is another version jump due to the
number of fixes, enhancements, and new features:

  * Fix issue where packages were sometimes incorrectly identified as
    already being in the build queue when they were not; thanks to
    SpacePlod for the bug report and thanks to Mauro Giachero for
    further bug reporting and providing a patch to fix it.
  * Add ability to pass build options/flavors/arguments to the
    SlackBuild when using the dialog interface.
  * Include ability to reverse or manually sort the items in the build
    queue; thanks to Mauro Giachero for the patches to implement these
    features.
  * Move all the queue functions into a separate 'Manage Queue'
    submenu off the main menu.
  * Allow user to save (and load) the build queue between sessions by
    specifing a file and location, so multiple saved queues can be
    maintained.
  * Automatically backup the current queue upon exiting and offer to
    reload upon first entering the queue submenu.
  * Provide a menu entry to clear the build queue.
  * Merge in several patches from Mauro Giachero to display the SVN
    version number; clean up use of cancel/back and ESC (ESC now takes
    you back a step in most dialogs); improve the cleanup process; and
    improve the new build flavors/options dialog.
  * Apply several patches from slakmagik for various little fixes,
    cleanups, and tweaks.
  * Create a new 'Utilities' submenu off the main menu and move some
    of the less-important items there in order to clean up the main
    menu.  It was getting a bit bulky.  :-)
  * Add ability to download a new sbopkg package when there is an
    update.
  * Include optional use of a ~/.sbopkg.conf, which will override
    settings in the system /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf file.
  * When changing the Slackware version in the dialog interface, offer
    the user the opportunity to save this change in the new
    ~/.sbopkg.conf file.
  * Improve build queue logging and error reporting; correctly remove
    symlink to the source tarball when build fails.
  * Bump default wget timeout from 10 to 15 seconds which prevents
    some downloads from failing.
  * Add update list fix for ksmoothdock; thanks to Wade Grant for the
    bug report.
  * Improve how the sources are downloaded and identified.
  * Remove the 'read sbopkg README' from the main menu.
  * Add a directory check for OUTPUT since that is now required.
  * Add preliminary check to make sure command line options -b and -i
    are not used together.
  * Fix issue where certain packages in queue that end with a ++ (like
    libsigc++) could not be added.
+--------------------------+

Sbopkg version 0.20.0 released.  This a version jump due to the
numerous fixes, enhancements, and new features.

New features:

  * There is a new -i command line switch that allows the user to
    build and install packages in a manner similar to the current -b
    switch for building only.  As with the -b switch, the user can
    build and install more than one package by listing them in quotes.
    And, by carefully listing dependencies in the right order, it
    might be possible to build and install dependencies and the final,
    target package in one go, like this:

    # sbopkg -i "imlib2 giblib feh"

    In this case, imlib2 must be built and installed before giblib,
    both of which need to be built and installed before feh.  Given
    the nature of building dependencies, this may not always work, but
    it still may be helpful and useful in many cases.
  * Coupled with the new -i switch, there is a new 'build queue' in
    the dialog interface.  The user can add packages to the queue and
    then, when ready, can process the queue in the order the packages
    are listed.  The user can choose to build only or build and
    install the packages in the queue.  Again, by listing dependencies
    in the right order, it may be possible to build dependencies and
    the final, target package in one go like the feh example above.
  * After checking for updates, the user is offered the opportunity to
    add those flagged updates to the build queue automatically.
  * When building packages individually outside of the build queue,
    the user is offered the opportunity to build or build and install
    the package.
  * There is a new -u command line switch, and a corresponding new
    dialog menu selection, that allows the user to check if there is
    an update to sbopkg itself.
  * A new DEBUG variable is introduced to the sbopkg.conf file that
    allow for easier debugging and update list bug reporting.  See the
    sbopkg.conf man page for more detail.

Bug Fixes:

  * Fix issues with the "Installed/Not Installed" text at the top of
    info item menu screen.  Thanks to Erik Hanson and Mauro Giachero
    for assistance with this issue.
  * Improve the wording and button labeling of several dialogs; thanks
    to Erik Hanson for a patch to implement several of these
    improvements and thanks to The-Croupier for suggestions on
    another.
  * Clean up the customization menu.
  * Fix issue with typhoon_2001 not building correctly; thanks to
    cotterochan for the bug report.
  * Fix django download issue due to their weird tarball naming
    scheme; thanks to David Somero for the bug report.
  * Fix mplayer update issue; thanks to all the folks that reported
    this one.  Clearly, mlayer is a popular app.  :-)
  * Fix acroread update issue; thanks to Erik Hanson for the bug
    report.
  * Fix build queue failure issue found in 0.20.0rc1 due to not
    recovering from control-c cleanly; thanks to Mauro Giachero for
    the bug report.
  * Fix issue found in 0.20.0rc1 where packages could be added to
    queue more than once which caused some funky behavior; thanks to
    Mauro Giachero for the bug report.
  * Fix issue found in 0.20.0rc1 where customized SlackBuilds were not
    being used in the build process; thanks to Mauro Giachero for the
    bug report.
  * Fix issue found in 0.20.0rc1 where the queue processing would
    continue even after removing all packages from the queue; thanks
    to Mauro Giachero for the bug report.

Changes to sbopkg.conf:

As a result of some of these new features, users are advised of three
changes to the sbopkg.conf file.  Users can either manually update
their existing sbopkg.conf file or use the sbopkg.conf.new file that
is installed when you upgrade sbopkg.

sbopkg.conf change 1: OUTPUT is now required.  This was commented out
in prior versions of sbopkg.conf.  The default setting of OUTPUT is:

export OUTPUT=${OUTPUT:-/tmp}

this is the same default setting in SBo SlackBuild scripts themselves.

sbopkg.conf change 2: TERMBUILD is deprecated.  All building and
installing switches now out of dialog and occurs in a terminal in all
cases.  Having the build take place inside the dialog interface caused
some issues and made it difficult to implement some of the new
features.  So, it went.  As a result, you can delete TERMBUILD from
your sbopkg.conf file.

sbopkg.conf change 3: As mentioned above, DEBUG is a new required
variable in the sbopkg.conf file.  The default setting is DEBUG=0.
+--------------------------+

Congrats to Patrick and the team on the new release of Slackware
12.2.

Sbopkg version 0.15.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Slackware 12.2 is now the default Slackware version selected when
    using sbopkg.
  * Fix an issue where sometimes a built package was incorrectly
    listed in the software info item menu, i.e. mplayer-codecs-all
    instead of mplayer.  Thanks to necropresto for the bug report.
  * Add --no-owner to default rsync flags to avoid having the local
    SBo repo tagged with owner 1016 permissions.  Thanks to Pierre
    Cazenave for the bug report and Erik Hanson for the suggested
    solution.
+--------------------------+
Thu Dec 4 09:35:09 UTC 2008
Sbopkg version 0.14.1 released.  This is a minor bug-fix release:

  * Fix issue where certain package names were showing up incorrectly
    in the 'install' option - i.e. mplayer instead of
    mplayer-codecs-all.  Thanks to necropresto for the bug report.
  * A few little cleanups and cruft-removal.
+--------------------------+
Sun Nov 16 17:15:49 UTC 2008
Sbopkg version 0.14.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Various fixes related to the SlackBuilds.org update changing
    certain 'xx' to '++', such as TiMidity++, libsigc++, and libxml++.
  * The info item menus now display the repo's software version in the
    menu title, and also display whether the package has been
    installed at the top of the screen.  This is a really nice
    improvement.  Thanks to Erik Hanson for the patch.
  * Improve the Control-C trapping.
  * Fix the issue where simply pressing 'Enter' in the search box
    would result in all packages in the repo being listed as search
    results.  Now, it just returns to the main menu.
  * Fix xerces-c issue in the update list.  Thanks to João Felipe
    Santos for the bug report.
  * Lots of other little cleanups and cruft-removal.
  * Also, the sbopkg package itself now has a tag at the end, in
    keeping with typical Slackware package convention.

In addition, a new home page (http://www.sbopkg.org) has been set up.
Many thanks to the guys at cardinal.lizella.net, and their colocation
provider, Cyberlink International (http://cyberlinkint.com) for the
hosting.
+--------------------------+
Tue Oct 28 14:06:56 UTC 2008
Sbopkg version 0.13.1 released.  This is primarily a bug-fix release:

  * A fix for OpenOffice.org not being picked up correctly on the
    updatelist feature.  Thanks to Erik Hanson for the bug report.
  * A fix for a couple issues that appeared with the changes to the
    rsync and wget flags in version 0.13.0.  Thanks to Ken Roberts and
    Jorge Gaton for the bug reports.  To remedy this problem, I have
    removed TIMEOUT from sbopkg.conf and instead added two optional
    variables, RSYNCFLAGS and WGETFLAGS.  These options have been
    populated with some of the flags that were previously in the
    sbopkg script itself.  This means that folks can manually tweak
    the flags used by rsync and wget, although in most cases the
    defaults should be left alone.  This also means that for those who
    are upgrading sbopkg from a previous version will again need to
    manually update their sbopkg.conf from the sbopkg.conf.new that is
    installed and merge the changes.  Sorry about these changes to the
    configuration file, but hopefully they are for the better since
    these changes fix the problems mentioned previously and also give
    the users a bit more control over the flags used, if desired.
+--------------------------+
Sat Oct 25 12:38:34 UTC 2008
Sbopkg version 0.13.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * New code has been added to allow the user to cleanly abort the
    source download by pressing Control-C; thanks to Zordak for the
    suggestion.
  * Add in several improvements to the rsync and wget stages, whereby
    better error messages are detected and displayed, -z is removed
    from rsync, and other general cleanups; thanks to macavity for the
    suggestions and patches.
  * Add in -O option to wget to allow for cases where downloaded
    source name is different than expected (such as virtualbox-ose);
    thanks to acidchild for the bug report.
  * Add in new sbopkg.conf variable TIMEOUT to allow the user to
    manually set the timeout value for rsync and wget; thanks to
    macavity for the suggestion.  NOTE:  this will require users
    upgrading from previous versions to either merge the new
    sbopkg.conf into their existing file, or manually add a TIMEOUT=10
    (default is 10 seconds) to their existing sbopkg.conf file.
  * Add in several updatelist fixes; thanks to Erik Hanson for the bug
    reports.
  * Add in fix where searching for category names would create
    problems; thanks to nille for the bug report.
  * Add in some new code in an initial attempt to fix the 'decimal'
    problem in bash, in which comparing package versions (like 3.9
    versus 3.11) would result in incorrect updatelist results.  This
    code should fix some updatelist errors reported by Erik Hanson,
    samac, and João Felipe Santos.  This new code needs testing, so
    please check the updatelist and then consider running it with the
    debug feature enabled and check the results the again.  See the
    UPDATELIST-DEBUGGING document for details on how to enable
    debugging.
  * Fix size of several dialog boxes for a better UI; thanks to Erik
    Hanson for the bug report.
  * Several error-checking and graceful exit cleanups and fixes.
+--------------------------+
Tue Oct 7 14:05:36 UTC 2008
Sbopkg version 0.12.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * New code that better catches MD5SUM failures and offers the
    opportunity to delete the corrupted source.
  * New menu entry that allows a user to manually delete the saved
    sources for any particular software in the SBo repository.  Thanks
    to Drew Ames for the bug reports and suggestions that led to both
    of these two fixes and additions.
  * Add in ability to edit the *.info file in a similar manner to
    editing the SlackBuild.  With this addition, a user can now
    manually update the .info and SlackBuild from within sbopkg and
    build and install an updated package before it hits the repo.  If
    you use vi/vim as your EDITOR and want an easy way to insert the
    MD5SUM of a new source tarball, try ":r! md5sum
    /path/to/new/source".  Then clean up the inserted information into
    a proper .info file layout.  Thanks to nille for prodding me to
    get this done.
  * Move the editing functions into a submenu to better organize the
    'info item' menu for each software selection.  Thanks to nille for
    the suggestion.
  * Several error-checking and graceful exit cleanups and fixes.
+--------------------------+
Tue Sep 16 22:41:34 UTC 2008
Sbopkg version 0.11.2 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * The pid file is now properly removed when using sbopkg from the
    cli; many thanks to LukenShiro for the bug report and help with
    testing.
  * Checks for the various sbopkg-related directories and files are
    improved.
  * A couple of updatelist fixes; thanks to LukenShiro for the bug
    reports.
+--------------------------+
Fri Sep 12 12:32:07 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.11.1 released.  This is a minor bug fix for version
0.11.0.
+--------------------------+
Fri Sep 12 09:51:39 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.11.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * After many, _many_ requests, sbopkg now adds preliminary support
    to install a package by calling upgradepkg --reinstall
    --install-new.  Currently, this new feature is only available in
    the dialog interface (the cli version will include this feature
    shortly).  If sbopkg finds a package for the selected application
    in the OUTPUT directory, then a new menu item will automagically
    appear allowing the user to install the package.  Thanks very much
    to Erik Hanson for the initial code to get this working.  Please
    do test this functionality and let me know if there are any
    issues.
  * Much improved menu navigation -- the 'Return to Main Menu' feature
    that appeared in the last release is now moved down as a button
    next to "Ok" and "Back."  Additionally, several of "Cancel"
    buttons are renamed "Back." I think these changes greatly improve
    things from a user interface perspective.  Thanks to Erik Hanson
    for the suggestions.
  * There is a new option in sbopkg.conf "TERMBUILD" that allows a
    user to optionally have the package building process step outside
    of dialog and process in a regular terminal.  Thanks to Erik
    Hanson for the suggestion and patch to make this work.
  * Create a pid file when sbopkg is first run and check for its
    existence to prevent multiple instances of sbopkg from running.
    Thanks to David Somero for the suggestion.
  * Add in several bugfixes for the update list.  Thanks to Erik
    Hanson and The-spiki for the bug reports.
+--------------------------+
Tue Aug 26 23:53:13 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.10.0 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Committed a patch from that fixes ubuntulooks update bug, removes
    ARCH from the update comparison code to prevent false positive
    when different arches are used, and fixes libsigc++ and TiMidity++
    update bugs; thanks to Bert Babington for the patch.
  * Modified the sbopkg.conf file to allow easier/more correct
    exporting of variables; thanks to Ken Roberts for the patch and
    helpful dialog on the issue.  Please note that the default sbopkg
    TMP has moved from /tmp to /tmp/SBo, so be sure to move your
    permanent build log and package debugging list, if any, to the new
    location.
  * Renamed sbopkg.conf.sample to sbopkg.conf.new and incorporate a
    doinst.sh script per general Slackware convention; thanks to Ken
    Roberts for the suggestion, patch, and doinst.sh script.  This
    sbopkg.conf.new is the new 'sample' configuration file.  As such,
    please back up your old sbopkg.conf and then consider merging any
    changes you made to your old sbopkg.conf and then renaming the
    sbopkg.conf.new to sbopkg.conf.
  * Add a "Return to Main Menu' function in the package information
    menu; thanks to Murat D. Kadirov for the suggestion.
  * Include fixes for several other packages in the update code.
  * Fixed some typos; thanks to samac for the report.
  * Add a feature to view the sbopkg README from the main menu.
  * Lots and lots of little fixes, tweaks, and cleanups throughout the
    script.  The error checking and other similar low-level plumbing
    issues are generally improved.
  * Several changes/edits to the man pages and other documentation.
+--------------------------+
Wed Aug 13 23:06:07 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.0.9 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Several bug fixes in the update list to prevent false positives.
    Thanks to ktabic and Antoine for the bug reports.
  * Fixed some things so that a user can now correctly set a different
    TMP, SRCDIR, OUTPUT etc. in sbopkg.conf, which means that
    someone can completely segregate sbopkg and it's related
    SBo-building and package dumping directories, for example,
    /sbo/tmp, /sbo/cache, /sbo/packages etc.  See the sbopkg.conf(5)
    man page for details.  Thanks to Ken Roberts for the bug report.
  * New features include the ability to clear the cache directory from
    within the dialog interface and to display all installed SBo
    packages in the dialog and cli.
  * The search results page has been improved and the user can now
    jump directly to a package's information menu from the search
    results page.  Thanks to Erik Hanson for the diffs, suggestions,
    whitespace cleanups, and bug fixes.
  * Menu navigation has been greatly improved so that sbopkg remembers
    where you are when navigating up and down through the menus.
    Again, big thanks to Erik Hanson for this improvement.
+--------------------------+
Sun Aug 3 21:02:27 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.0.8 released.  The major addition to this version is
the ability to search for and display potential updates to SBo
packages installed on the user's system.  There are also verious other
bug-fixes and code cleanups.  Big thanks to Erik Hanson for his
suggestions and help with the new update code.
+--------------------------+
Fri May 16 22:20:52 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.0.7 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Sbopkg now properly creates the /home/sbo/12.1 directory if it
    doesn't exist (or equivalent as set in sbopkg.conf).  Note the
    user still has to manually create the 'root' directory where the
    SBo mirror will be held -- i.e. /home/sbo in this example.
  * Category list menu has been tweaked to include the two new SBo
    categories in the full view.
  * Some old commented out cruft has been removed.
+--------------------------+
Fri May 2 20:35:09 EST 2008
Congratulations to Patrick and the Slackware team on the release of
Slackware 12.1.

Sbopkg version 0.0.6.1 released.  The only change is to set the
default SBo repository to 12.1 and update the man pages etc. to
reference Slackware 12.1.  Otherwise, there are no substantive changes
over 0.0.6.
+--------------------------+
Sun Apr 13 10:24:27 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.0.6 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Ability to rsync with and browse SBo repos for different Slackware
    versions (currently 11.0 and 12.0, and will be updated when 12.1
    is out).
  * Improved search functionality for cli.  The -s switch is the same
    as before, and will display the README, *.info etc. for a
    particular package name.  New, however, is -q, which will search
    for packages by string and return a list of possible matches.
    This is now the search used in the dialog interface as well.
  * Various other cleanups and bugfixes.

Also, the sbopkg Google Groups list has been created:

http://groups.google.com/group/sbopkg-discuss
+--------------------------+
Wed Apr 2 14:29:36 EST 2008
Sbopkg version 0.0.5 released.  This version contains the following
fixes and enhancements:

  * Users can now copy and edit the SlackBuild within the dialog
    interface, keeping both the original and edited SlackBuild.
  * Build packages using original or edited SlackBuild.
  * Fixes to the permanent build log so it actually works from dialog
    or cli. ;-)
  * Ability to view/delete the permanent build log within dialog
    interface.
  * Basic search functionality built in to the dialog interface (shows
    what category a piece of software is in);
  * Better viewing of the README, .info, slack-desc, and SlackBuild
    from cli.
  * Various other cleanups.
+--------------------------+

  * Build process window remains in state correctly, as does the rsync
    window.
  * Source tarballs are saved in a separate SRCDIR directory and
    symlinked to the build directory.
  * Can browse this SRCDIR cache directory within the dialog
    interface.
  * Thanks to slackmagik for several of these excellent suggestions
    and contributions.
